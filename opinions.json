The decisions we make today about hiring and research funding in the Doerr School will shape the knowledge, skills and values that Stanford graduates bring to sustainability problem-solving for decades to come.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we have <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/05\/12\/from-the-community-stanford-has-a-chance-at-a-real-school-of-sustainability-if-it-refuses-fossil-fuel-meddling\/\">made <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/02\/from-the-community-should-any-fossil-fuel-company-qualify-for-funding-stanfords-school-of-sustainability-a-response-to-dean-majumdars-letter\/\">clear<\/a>, we welcome the opportunity to join this conversation to critically evaluate the mission-alignment of the programs that will be part of the new school. Incoming Dean Arun Majumdar has made <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.stanford.edu\/news\/message-arun-majumdar-looking-forward\">multiple promises<\/a> of a listening tour to engage with students, faculty and staff about the principles the Doerr School will uphold. Thus far, Dean Majumdar&#x2019;s office has scheduled private meetings with faculty, students and postdocs in each department separately but has not scheduled public forums. We contend that, without including public forums, this approach artificially silos conversations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure that the process for establishing shared values and criteria is as transparent, inclusive, and effective as possible, we demand the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Participatory town halls at least once a month, beginning at the start of the fall quarter. These town halls must encourage interaction and active dialogue, be open to the whole Stanford Doerr School community (across departments, faculty, staff and students) and must either:<ul><li>be in-person with online options for those who can only join remotely OR<\/li><li>if conducted virtually, allow for real-time questions and comments by attendees (no webinars)<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>A full schedule with town hall dates and office hours communicated to the Stanford community at least two weeks in advance<\/li><li>No new funding from fossil fuel companies while the listening tour is ongoing<\/li><li>A commitment to discussing and establishing clear, objective and impactful criteria for industry partnerships and enforcing the criteria once they are published<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dean Majumdar has not responded to our request for details on the administration&#x2019;s plans for the listening tour, nor have we heard whether or not Town Halls will be scheduled. In the meantime:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The Doerr School <a href=\"https:\/\/energy.stanford.edu\/news\/stanford-s-strategic-energy-alliance-funds-six-new-energy-research-projects-total-5-million\">has already accepted over $5 million<\/a> in new funding from Shell, Total, ExxonMobile, and Bank of America via the Strategic Energy Alliance.<\/li><li>More than <a href=\"https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/FossilFreeSustainabilitySchool\">700 students, faculty and staff <\/a>(and counting) agree that entangling the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability with fossil fuel companies would mark a conflict of interest and would thereby undermine the school&#x2019;s mission. This sentiment is shared by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dataforprogress.org\/blog\/2022\/7\/14\/voters-agree-fossil-fuel-funding-in-climate-research-presents-conflict-of-interest\">general public<\/a>. We have shown that many of <a href=\"https:\/\/truesustainabilityschool.com\/paris\">our partners<\/a> currently <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/02\/from-the-community-should-any-fossil-fuel-company-qualify-for-funding-stanfords-school-of-sustainability-a-response-to-dean-majumdars-letter\/\">fail to pass<\/a> the <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.stanford.edu\/news\/message-arun-majumdar-looking-forward\">four criteria<\/a> laid out by the Dean to determine the integrity of fossil fuel companies. Funding criteria and their enforcement should also reflect the demands of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gofossilfreestanford.org\/the-project\">Fossil Free Stanford,<\/a> and Stanford Alumni for Climate Action.&#xA0;<\/li><li>Despite <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.stanford.edu\/news\/faculty-cluster-hires-launched-climate-science-sustainable-development-environmental-justice\">signaling it would<\/a>, the Doerr school <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/22\/school-of-sustainabilitys-leadership-must-reinvest-in-environmental-justice-and-a-fossil-free-future\/\">has yet to launch<\/a> a true environmental justice (EJ) faculty cluster hire. Such a process <a href=\"https:\/\/www.science.org\/content\/article\/nih-s-new-cluster-hiring-program-aims-help-schools-attract-diverse-faculty\">would involve<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insightintodiversity.com\/cluster-hiring-grows-in-popularity-as-institutions-act-to-increase-faculty-diversity-and-advance-social-justice\/\">recruiting a group of scholars<\/a> to establish (interdisciplinary) EJ research at Stanford: a <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.stanford.edu\/departments\/departments\/institutes-and-initiatives\">stated<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.stanford.edu\/news\/qa-education-programs-within-new-school\">goal<\/a> of the Doerr school.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We therefore call on the Dean to initiate a transparent process for consulting with environmental justice experts and supporters on the school&#x2019;s hiring, funding, partnerships, and other critical decisions.<strong> <\/strong>The process should reflect the findings of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ejstanford.com\/new-school-focused-on-sustainability.html\">Environmental Justice Working Group<\/a>&#xA0;and its intergenerational leadership team of students, faculty and staff<strong>.<\/strong> Illustrating the broad and longstanding support for hiring EJ scholars at Stanford, the EJWG received over <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2021\/01\/27\/environmental-justice-must-be-foundational-to-the-new-school-of-sustainability\/\">800 signatures in support of its 2018 EJ cluster hire proposal<\/a> &#x2013; a priority that should be reflected in new school hiring decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A siloed and closed-door decision-making process is vulnerable to <a href=\"https:\/\/truesustainabilityschool.com\/big-oil-entanglements\">special interest groups<\/a> and short-sighted decisions that will forego deeper inquiry and deliberation on how we might build a new school that benefits the broader global community and generations to come. Given the long-term impact of these decisions, we urge Dean Majumdar and the Doerr School leadership to shape the school in a truly transparent and democratic manner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an opportunity for the Doerr School to demonstrate true leadership in this time of climate crisis. We look forward to joining the conversation in coming weeks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Undersigned,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/truesustainabilityschool.com\/\">Coalition for a True School of Sustainability<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Co-signed by:<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Yannai Kashtan: Yannai Kashtan is a Knight-Hennessy Scholar and a Ph.D. student in the Earth System Science program, where he researches the health effects of burning fossil fuels in the home.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Thom Hersbach: Thom Hersbach is a postdoctoral scholar at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, where he studies electrochemical hydrogen production and biomass conversion; the statements in this article are his personal opinions and do not reflect the official views of the US Department of Energy or Stanford University.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>June Choi: June Choi is a Ph.D. student in Earth System Science, researching the distributional welfare impacts of climate change.&#xA0;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daly Wettermark: Daly Wettermark is a masters student in Environmental Engineering, working in the field of wastewater treatment and reuse.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Celina Scott-Buechler: Celina Scott-Buechler is a Ph.D. student in the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program for Environment &amp; Resources (E-IPER) where she works to bridge climate science and policy.

Decades. All that wealth &#x2014; and for what? Truly a waste. You have no excuse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the way, when I address &#x201C;Stanford&#x201D; here, I am addressing those in positions of power and authority. The more power you have, and the more you are being paid, the more accountable you are to your community and for Stanford&#x2019;s failures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: In 2000, you let your &#x201C;star&#x201D; faculty violate my 22-year-old self. That&#x2019;s how my career began &#x2014; with violence I am still struggling to comprehend. I was so naive and inexperienced I was confused by what was happening.

How dare you! How dare you invade my home?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: This letter is repetitive because traumatic re-living is repetitive and you continue to resurrect those hideous memories by making headlines about rape culture on your campus.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: My parents sacrificed a lot to give me a life less chaotic and violent than theirs. They trusted you to keep their daughter safe from the &#x201C;bad&#x201D; behavior of serial abusers. Their trust was betrayed  &#x2014; not once, not twice, but over and over and over and over and over again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: CUNY is underfunded. You are overfunded. What is the correct way to redress such inequality? I don&#x2019;t know. I do know that letting your rape culture make contact with CUNY students is the wrong way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: Colleagues were &#8220;repeatedly asked to &#x2018;babysit&#x2019; Barletta&#8221;? In what universe is such infantilization of a serial abuser acceptable?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: You cannot possibly claim that you are &#x201C;helpless&#x201D; here, that you &#x201C;had no idea,&#x201D; that you are understaffed or under-resourced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: When I was a 22-year-old first-year Ph.D. student in your English Department, your &#x201C;star&#x201D; faculty raped and harassed me. I was unable, under such circumstances, to excel, to collaborate with colleagues (he isolated me), unable at times to work (I was too busy trying to avoid being raped), often unable to think at all. And my abuser did this to others at Stanford too. Not only did my abuser harm multiple students, but you continue to allow <a href=\"https:\/\/academic-sexual-misconduct-database.org\/incidents?query=stanford\">multiple people in positions of power and authority to harm generations of students and employees<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: How could you. How could you <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/news\/2008\/march12\/oldbooks-031208.html\">name that library in his honor<\/a> after you yourself punished him for what he did to me? He used one of those <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/SAAASA\/permalink\/5687106724695954\">books<\/a> to &#x2014; I won&#x2019;t finish this sentence. I won&#x2019;t go there. Not again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: You have squandered my patience and goodwill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/pr\/92\/920602Arc2192.html\">Archuleta<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/19\/a-stanford-professor-sexually-harassed-his-student-a-decade-ago-some-female-students-say-his-inappropriate-behavior-never-stopped\/\">Barletta<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/stanfordpolitics.org\/2017\/12\/03\/jay-fliegelman-sexual-misconduct\/\">Fliegelman<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2017\/11\/16\/harassment-assault-allegations-against-moretti-span-three-campuses\/\">Moretti<\/a> &#x2014; why? Just &#x2014; why?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: This is not how I want to be spending my summer. I was actually working on my book project when news about Vincent Barletta &#x201C;mentoring&#x201D; CUNY students reset my brain&#x2019;s time zone to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/PTSD?src=hashtag_click\">#PTSD<\/a>. For the past month, I&#x2019;ve been re-living the year 2000 (when your &#x201C;star&#x201D; faculty violated my 22-year-old self).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: Fuck you for <a href=\"https:\/\/stanfordmag.org\/contents\/remembering-jay-fliegelman\">covering up<\/a> the abuse and the punishment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: You are Victor Frankenstein and my suffering is the creature you made. Take responsibility for your creation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: I had just turned 22 years old.&nbsp; I was naive and inexperienced. I was a first-year graduate student, new to the profession, new to teaching, new to California, new to Stanford. He was tenured. He was powerful. He was in his 50s. <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/pr\/2007\/pr-fliegelman-082207.html\">He had been a Stanford institution for decades<\/a>. This is disjointed because I&#8217;m reliving it all over again. Shortly after he violated me, I was hospitalized. Shortly after I was discharged from the hospital, I gave a <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn.kqed.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/10\/2017\/12\/Syllabus.jpg\">guest lecture on Seneca Falls and women&#x2019;s rights<\/a>. His response was to tell me I forgot to mention women&#8217;s right to sexual pleasure. There are gaps here because trauma is nonlinear, trauma broke my sense of time. At some point you conducted an investigation. As a <a href=\"https:\/\/academic-sexual-misconduct-database.org\/person\/jay-fliegelman\">result<\/a> of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.documentcloud.org\/documents\/4323656-Debra-Zumwalt-Letter-to-Seo-Young-Chu-11-27-2017.html\">the investigation<\/a>, which was a brutal experience, you punished my abuser by suspending him for two years without pay. Some of his colleagues had the gall to blame me for the whole debacle.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: By enabling rape culture and abuse to flourish, you promote hostile thinking environments. You poison ideas. You destroy minds. You weaken intellectual communities. You prevent work from happening.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: Every minute, hour, day, week, month, year, decade of your silence and inaction is disrupting my &#x201C;career,&#x201D; is relevant to my work, has shaped my sense of self as an academic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: I&#x2019;ve never sued you. I&#x2019;ve generously given you free feedback. I&#x2019;ve extended every deadline. I&#x2019;ve been more than patient with you. I&#x2019;ve spent countless hours <a href=\"https:\/\/asapjournal.com\/after-a-refuge-for-jae-in-doe-a-social-media-chronology\/\">educating you<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/asecsgradcaucus.wordpress.com\/2017\/11\/11\/asecs-executive-board-statement-on-harassment-and-abuse\/\">cleaning up your messes<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: By criticizing you I am not &#x201C;attacking&#x201D; your students, alumni, and workers. I am trying to make your campus better. Safer. More hospitable to learning. By speaking out like this I am trying to be a good alumna. I hope you are paying attention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: The truth is that my career started with rape. My career has been shaped by rape. My sense of who I am as an academic: shaped by rape. The gaps in my CV are trauma-generated plot holes that lead to Northern California in the year 2000.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: I&#x2019;m angry, I&#x2019;m disabled, I have work to do, I have a migraine. I want to lie down and shut my eyes and rest. But this is too important. I can&#x2019;t rest until CUNY is safe from your rape culture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: Have you even read &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/entropymag.org\/a-refuge-for-jae-in-doe-fugues-in-the-key-of-english-major\/\">A Refuge for Jae-in Doe<\/a>&#x201D;? The whole point of my sharing all that pain &#x2014; and in a language your English Department would understand: sonnets! The Western Canon! English (Major)! &#x2014; was to prevent more students from being harmed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: I am as &#x201C;proud&#x201D; to have a degree from your school as I would be &#x201C;proud&#x201D; to sport a blood diamond. Yes, the degree may glitter. But how much pain, injustice, conflict, humiliation, abuse, and violence does such glitter belie?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: I am ashamed to be associated with you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: If I were to write a book about your response to my requests for answers and answerability, most of the book&#x2019;s pages would be blank. Vacuous. Empty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: Emptiness, too, is a response. And by definition it is worthless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: Speaking out does not come naturally to me.

feedback is necessary for graduate admissions"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>7:25 p.m. &#x2014; I nervously checked the time on my computer, while wiping away the beads of sweat that had started to form on my forehead. I had been praying, nay, pleading, for the last 10 minutes &#x2014; &#x201C;Please let this interview go well.&#x201D; I was on my last set of graduate school interviews. This was my last chance, I had been rejected everywhere else. I had no idea what I was doing wrong &#x2014; the platitudes of &#x201C;just be yourself&#x201D; from my classmates rang hollow within me.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just internalized it &#x2014; if &#x201C;just be yourself&#x201D; was not working, then something was definitely wrong with me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7:29 p.m. &#x2014; One minute to go. I took a final swig of water and thought to myself, &#x201D;If I ever find myself on the other side of the table, won&#x2019;t I change a few things&#x2026;&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been two years since that fateful interview day. Although I am currently a graduate student here at Stanford, I still have no idea what happened and why I was admitted. But in those two years, the pressing need to figure out what went wrong with the other interviews never left me. &#x201C;Why do you care, you are already at Stanford?&#x201D; was the common reaction I got from my acquaintances whenever I brought it up.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I do care &#x2014; I care deeply. Not because of my ego, but because of the reason why I am in graduate school. I am training to become a better engineer and scientist. And the only way to become a better engineer and scientist is through feedback.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As scientists, we receive feedback from every single situation &#x2014; when we submit manuscripts, we receive feedback from the editors and peer reviewers. When we submit grants, we receive feedback from NSF and NIH panelists. When we defend or give our qualifying examinations, we get feedback from our committee members and those who listen to us. When we go up for tenure, we get feedback from the tenure committee. Every basic interaction between lab colleagues allows us to refine and change our ideas and methods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So why is it that admissions, perhaps the most critical part of one&#8217;s journey to becoming a scientist, has to be the most Kafkaesque process? Departments at Stanford have policies that they will not release feedback about their decisions to students. Let me again point out how asinine that is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As scientists, we strive for clarity, reproducibility and evidence &#x2014; if there is no clear criteria for those who are admitted and those who are not, we are creating a game of chance, an unequal opportunity between those who understand the &#x201C;game&#x201D; and those who do not.&nbsp; For many of us who have been admitted, it is a case of survivorship bias; we may not care about what our interviewers thought &#x2014; we got in.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the reality is that there are hundreds of others who haven&#x2019;t gotten in &#x2014; there is about a 10% acceptance rate in my department. For many of them, who passed the initial screening and reached the interview stage, having that extra feedback from the professors who spent the time interacting with the applicant will go a long way in helping their futures in other grad school interviews, or in general become better at the interview process. By denying all of this, growth is stunted.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In particular, this unduly affects groups who are less likely to understand the &#x201C;game&#x201D; &#x2014; first-time higher education seekers, immigrants, people of color and people from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, as evidenced by the Department of Education&#x2019;s own <a href=\"https:\/\/www2.ed.gov\/rschstat\/research\/pubs\/advancing-diversity-inclusion.pdf\">report<\/a> on higher education statistics.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some may argue that people do not have time to respond to the potentially hundreds of applicants. However, federal grant agencies illustrate that it is possible to make the time; many national grant agencies, in particular NSF and NIH, return grant feedback to submitters. If federal grant agencies and reviewers can afford to spend time to give feedback, so can admissions committees. While departments may view giving feedback as an inefficient waste of time and resources, I would argue such feedback is valuable in the long term. Using the departments&#x2019; logic, growing a tree is a waste of time. It may be &#x201C;inefficient&#x201D; to take time out of our busy lives to water it, but over 50 years, when we are long gone, that tree will provide shade for those who didn&#x2019;t have it before. We do not see the tree grow day to day, but if we do not water it daily, the tree will die before it has a chance to rise. In the same way, by not giving the applicants feedback, we are failing potential scientists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A perhaps darker interpretation can be taken that the lack of feedback and clarity is useful for maintaining a sense of &#x201C;prestige&#x201D; in the institution. It would be a lie to say that we don&#x2019;t profit from this idea; a degree from Stanford opens up so many opportunities because of its exclusivity. Antonio Gramsci, an Italian 20th century political prisoner under Benito Mussolini, defined this as the idea of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/title\/prison-notebooks\/oclc\/24009547\">cultural hegemony<\/a> &#x2014; the ruling class&#x2019;s beliefs, thoughts and expectations become the dominant accepted cultural norm in a culturally diverse society. We are lucky that we have the choice to not perpetuate this hegemony; let us use this to enact change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is easy to enact policies at the top of the chain to promote better representation; the real challenge starts at the roots so that more trees have a chance to grow. We have to rethink how graduate school admissions works, and really provide equitable opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it is important for us to take this issue up with our departments here. For the small number of us currently in the program, we will not see any benefit from it, but I guarantee you, thousands will thank us for it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Soham Sinha argues that departments should provide feedback to graduate school applicants. &#8220;As scientists we strive for clarity,

He focuses on the health impacts of climate change and the co-benefits of a sustainable and just energy transition.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, Stanford leadership has gestured toward an interest in environmental justice (EJ). This December, university leaders took an important step in launching the EJ Cluster Hire &#x2014; originally proposed by the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ejstanford.com\/\"> Stanford EJ Working Group<\/a> in 2018 and widely supported by the Stanford community. The goal is to fill a glaring gap: despite environmental justice being necessary to achieving a sustainable society, we have no environmental justice scholars on the Academic Council Stanford faculty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet through candidate interviews during campus visits (the EJ Working Group had no other role in the search), we learned that only one out of eleven interviewees self-identified as an environmental justice scholar. The vast majority of interviewees could not name an EJ scholar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We assert that this search cannot be constituted as the long-awaited &#x201C;EJ Cluster Hire.&#x201D; Further, we are highly concerned that Stanford appears willing to co-opt the words &#x201C;Environmental Justice&#x201D; without making a commitment to an established field of scholarship. To make this right, we need an intentional Environmental Justice cluster hire that is dedicated to expanding EJ expertise in the newly-minted Doerr School of Sustainability.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the spirit of repair, we have brought these concerns to new school leadership. During a sit-down interview with students a few weeks ago, Dean Arun Majumdar told us (on the record), &#x201C;You have my commitment that we will be looking at EJ, we will be hiring, and you will have the deep engagement that is necessary and the input from the EJ Working Group. That I can commit to.&#x201D;&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have heard similar statements before. We urge Dean Majumdar to reinvest in environmental justice as the foundation for true sustainability. Indeed, the Doerr School launch presents a unique opportunity to learn from Stanford&#x2019;s mistakes, create meaningful space for EJ and move us towards a just transition beyond fossil fuels. Can the Doerr School of Sustainability commit to visionary investments beyond big oil? Can the new school&#x2019;s leadership commit to investing in the knowledge and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ejstanford.com\/indigenous-leadership-in-the-emerging-green-economy.html\">expertise of frontline communities<\/a>?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This commitment is essential because achieving sustainability requires attending to the deep divisions and disparities that persist within and across societies. If we are not prioritizing environmental justice as a key framework that encourages research-to-action approaches that engage with the root causes of inequities and racialized oppression linked to environmental degradation, we will fail in our sustainability efforts. Yet with scholarly frameworks from EJ, our students gain the intellectual structures, research methodologies, and ethical understandings they need to avoid reproducing injustice when they go out into the world to &#x201C;solve&#x201D; sustainability problems that are deeply connected to ongoing histories of racialized discrimination, dispossession and injustice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>EJ scholarship extends beyond engaging with issues of inequality through policy or economic methods. Rather, it is an area of scholarship that centers the experiences, leadership and agency of frontline communities in research.<strong> <\/strong>According to this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teachingej.com\/about-us\/\">national EJ teaching and education database<\/a> coordinated by members of Stanford&#x2019;s Environmental Justice Working Group and additional partners, it &#x201C;is a framework at the nexus of social movements and research that centers the leadership and expertise of BIPOC [Black Indigenous People of Color] voices as it makes intersectional connections between painful histories of environmental racism and processes and practices of rebuilding a more equitable, healthy and safer world.&#x201D; As with other fields of research, EJ scholarship is rooted in a set of methodologies, literature and research traditions that are mutually recognized among EJ scholars and practitioners. These traditions have been established through the groundbreaking research of Robert Bullard, together with many others, as well as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ucc.org\/what-we-do\/justice-local-church-ministries\/justice\/faithful-action-ministries\/environmental-justice\/principles_of_environmental_justice\/\">EJ principles<\/a> set by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ucc.org\/30th-anniversary-the-first-national-people-of-color-environmental-leadership-summit\/\">First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While a true EJ cluster hire at Stanford would be a powerful step for our institution, Stanford will not be the first to attempt to fill this gap. We can look to President Biden&#x2019;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefing-room\/presidential-actions\/2021\/01\/20\/executive-order-protecting-public-health-and-environment-and-restoring-science-to-tackle-climate-crisis\/\">early directives<\/a> centering environmental justice and through the creation of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/environmentaljustice\/white-house-environmental-justice-advisory-council\">White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council<\/a>. We can even look to Stanford&#x2019;s peer institutions for guidance. Late last year, Berkeley <a href=\"https:\/\/www.diverseeducation.com\/faculty-staff\/article\/15114439\/new-cluster-hires-at-uc-berkeley-all-of-different-disciplines-will-focus-on-climate-equity\">successfully completed<\/a> its Climate Equity and Environmental Justice search, bringing on five scholars. Berkeley has also committed to cross-department cluster hires on issues relating to Native American and Indigenous People, Anti-Black Racism and Social Inclusion, Latinx and Democracy, Artificial Intelligence and Inequality and Understanding (Non) Citizenship. The new Yale School of the Environment <a href=\"https:\/\/environment.yale.edu\/news\/article\/dorceta-taylor-preeminent-environmental-justice-scholar-returns-to-yale\">recently hired<\/a> Dorceta Taylor, a preeminent EJ scholar; <a href=\"https:\/\/ycej.yale.edu\/en\/people\/gerald-torres\">Gerald Torres<\/a> is also a professor of Environmental Justice on Yale&#x2019;s faculty. Washington University St. Louis has an <a href=\"https:\/\/biology.wustl.edu\/news\/environmental-justice-cluster-three-assistant-professor-positions\">ongoing EJ-only<\/a> cluster hire, and the University of San Diego is also running a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sandiego.edu\/cas\/about\/diversity-equity-inclusion\/hiring.php\">cluster hire<\/a> with an EJ focus, among other institutions.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Moving forward, leadership should reinvest in a real, EJ-only cluster hire.<\/strong> This requires acknowledging that the recent cluster hire does not include environmental justice scholars. An EJ cluster hire cannot be EJ in name alone, but must reflect EJ values and be tailored specifically to EJ scholarship. Further, the hire would ideally follow best practices for diversity, equity and inclusion hires. Dean Majumdar need only engage directly with the students, staff and faculty who have been working to bring EJ to Stanford for years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we bring together diverse thinkers on campus to create the new school and to address complex problems like climate change &#x2014; known to create disproportionate levels of harm for historically marginalized communities &#x2014;&#xA0;we need EJ-centered leadership at the table in decision-making and policy-making. Lacking this, our leadership risks reproducing harm in the form of extractive research and policies that reinscribe disproportionate harm to historically marginalized communities of color.

we stand"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p><em>Jack Golub graduated Stanford in 2020. He now teaches English in Austin, Texas. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Classes of 2020 and 2021 (and perhaps even 2022),<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I left Stanford and became a teacher. My school is pretty different from Stanford, though. A lot of the students never pay attention. Our principal is a bit, uh, robotic. We don&#x2019;t treat our custodial staff as an integral part of our school community&#x2026; Alright, perhaps not as different as I thought.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In all seriousness, Stanford is different. At Stanford, I struggled. I often felt listless and confused. Spring quarter I&#x2019;d usually get a little depressed. I guess getting drunk at 11 a.m. just didn&#x2019;t do it for me. But I felt loved. I felt loved and supported by my peers, right from the start. My frosh year, half the dorm tried to help me learn CS106A. That they failed is irrelevant. My junior year, as an RA, I was down bad at times. My friends reached out to me. They came to see me. They listened, even when I had nothing to say. At Stanford, I felt confident that the people around me had my back. I knew my administration had the resources to provide me with an unparalleled education, including a daily menu of rich cultural events.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I largely felt that my Stanford journey lived up to our motto, &#x201C;let the winds of freedom blow.&#x201D; I was given a gift that let me grow. Not everyone gets that gift.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I currently teach seventh grade in Austin, Texas. I chose to teach because I thought I could connect deeply with students and uncover, for them to see, a surprisingly vast potential. Uvalde sits only a couple hours away from my school.&nbsp;Since May 24, grief and anger have stolen my thoughts. I have felt lost. I cried in front of my students as I lied to them, telling them that I would protect them no matter what, all while knowing that my body won&#x2019;t beat an AR-15. I have felt small. I needed to remind myself that we, recent and new Stanford graduates, stand on the shoulders of giants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand on the shoulders of the strong and loving Muwekma Ohlone tribe, a people who have survived and continue to survive colonialism and white supremacy. They are capable of such strength that they continue to love this sacred land, where they have lived for thousands of years, at every cost.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand with conviction on the shoulders of bell hooks, whose fierce voice for justice still resonates in her absence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand expressively, and yes, securely, on the shoulders of Issa Rae.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand in all-white Air-Force 1s on the shoulders of Phil Knight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand thousands of miles beyond earth on the shoulders of Mae Jemison and Sally Ride.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand on the physically less imposing yet altogether revolutionary shoulders of Sergey Brin and Larry Page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand bravely, ready to speak truth to power, on the shoulders of Christine Blasey Ford.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand on the shoulders of Stanford luminaries. Shoulders that are daunting in their size and, sometimes, in their shortcomings. To recognize how big we are, we must acknowledge both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand on the shoulders of the first president of Stanford, David Starr Jordan: pioneering psychologist, strategic president and prominent eugenicist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand on Leland Stanford&#x2019;s shoulders. Our founder who was ahead of his time in creating a coed school loosened from some constraints of established gender norms. He built this school with money made from exploiting Chinese railroad workers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have been poured into by our families and this school. Our teachers in the front of the room, our teachers sitting alongside us, our teachers serving us food, our teachers cleaning our bathrooms and those teachers calling us, asking when next are we coming home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2020 and 2021, we stand here, now, at the perfect time. We are not eager to burst forth, filled with passion and optimism, onto a broken world awaiting our leadership. We are not looking ahead to what doors this Stanford degree will open for us in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the future. We are already here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have learned that those doors won&#x2019;t magically open. Sometimes, the task of taking care of ourselves is more than enough for one day. The amazing future of fulfillment and powerful change that we normally would be promised during this weekend has, for many of us, not quite arrived on time. Maybe it got stuck in the Tresidder mail office. The line looks long, and I don&#x2019;t have my ID card anymore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I won&#x2019;t pretend that our good intentions and intelligence are enough. I won&#x2019;t ask for a moment of silence so that we can acknowledge our grief and then move on. The change we desperately need in the world won&#x2019;t happen until we change ourselves. Until we realize, collectively, that we have been given a gift that can never be earned or repaid. We stand so high, on such grand and great shoulders, such flawed shoulders, that we cannot come down. We are here to stay. Whatever we do with the power of our knowledge and our relationships furthers the legacy of this school. For better or for worse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of us have already begun honoring this gift. Since March 2020, we have learned of the courageous and creative capacities we hold within. When Stanford abruptly kicked us off campus we instinctively thought of others. We built a robust mutual aid network in mere days. One of us mobilized neighborhood helpers to deliver groceries to those that couldn&#x2019;t get them, literally feeding the hungry. Another assembled a team across the country to design and sell clothing and use the proceeds to buy crucial baby care items that parents and foster parents could not afford. Others of us served in less visible ways. We took care of, even homeschooled younger siblings. We helped family members and friends leave dangerous relationships and battle sickness. We started therapy to become better at loving one another, at loving ourselves. We survived after losing people dear to us. Finally, and this is true, one of us quit Goldman Sachs after only four weeks on the job.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The time to change our expectations of ourselves is not today. This whole weekend is the time to remember and celebrate and give thanks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To remember late nights in the lounge. The shock, which turned to thrill, then eventually irritation at roll outs. The relief at finishing finals followed by the bumbling camaraderie of Nomad. The randomly sunny, 80-degree winter days spent lounging, spike balling and pretending to do work. Those two weeks in 2017 where everyone simultaneously discovered Polo y Pan. The amazement of our first time at Gaieties. The, for some of us, sloppier enjoyment of all the other Gaieties. And, for a few of us, our naked prancing across the stage of our final Gaieties.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To celebrate that we did something difficult together. The challenges we overcame &#x2014; all those late nights in Green Library working on p-sets (I actually can&#x2019;t relate to that one; thank you, humanities), speakers antagonizing us yearly with their false narratives of Christian nationalism, COVID. The moments of triumph &#x2014; the band getting un-banned, securing pay raises for student staff, that moment during every Common Origins performance where all five hundred members are on stage at once and you&#x2019;re thinking to yourself, &#x201C;How is this possible?&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To give thanks that the frantic hallway goodbyes of March 2020 were not permanent. Thanks for the teachers and other staff who believed in us and challenged us in equal measure. For our frosh communities. For the creative writing classes that make everyone who takes them feel like we have something important to share. For the glorious culmination of fellowship that we call Special D. For the relentless student activists who showed us how bright our inner lights can shine in moments of crisis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today is the time to remind ourselves of the gift we have received.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomorrow is the time to change. To do the uncomfortable, setback-ridden work of loving one another more. To push our professional efforts, no matter what we do and especially if it seems unrelated to our society&#x2019;s challenges, closer towards justice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To stay humble and continue to fulfill this tremendously powerful gift.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomorrow, and every day after it, is the time to use that gift.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that one of my students makes it into Stanford.

It\u2019s been extraordinary"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Strive for the extraordinary. This was the topic of my college admissions essays and the mentality that took me on a trans-Atlantic journey to study in the United States. As a 12-year-old schoolgirl I was asked where I dreamed of attending university, and I shyly replied with the name of the nearest big city to my hometown in England. The smiling adult was suitably impressed, but I remember thinking to myself &#x2014; imagine their response if they knew the truth. I want to attend university in California.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s difficult to pinpoint exactly when or where the dream started, but this was the moment when I decided for myself to turn this dream into a plan. I was probably inspired in the early days by &#x201C;High School Musical&#x201D; or some other Disney Channel fantasy filled with cheerleaders, dancing on the tables during lunch break, and teenagers wearing their <em>own clothes <\/em>instead of a school uniform. But on reflection, there was something more about California that called out to me. I pictured a way of life where my disability would cease to be a barrier due to the warmer climate and relative accessibility of the environment compared to the ancient architecture of the U.K. I fantasized about rolling along smooth, wide boulevards in my powered wheelchair and basking in the independence that a college campus would afford me. I was enchanted by the idea of being different for some reason other than my disability, relishing in the prospect of small talk about my accent and growing up in a quaint British town. As I felt increasingly isolated from my school friends because of my physical limitations, I longed for a taste of acceptance and believed America held the answer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I thrive on having a goal and I knew what I had to do to put my plans into action. Learning was something I excelled at and getting good grades was the only option. My anxieties about fitting in among my peers faded because I had my sights set somewhere beyond high school, and I accepted not being able to go out and socialize in the same way as everyone else because I was using that time to get where I wanted more than anything to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I developed the confidence to share my ambitions, I learned that it&#x2019;s okay for people not to believe in you. In part, their laughter at my plans energized me because I knew that I was about to prove them all wrong. At the precise moment my parents were told I would not survive beyond the age of six, my life became all about defying the odds. One by one, I worked through the list of components that would make studying abroad possible: academic achievement, impressive extracurriculars, generous financial aid, access to robust healthcare, complex travel logistics for my powered wheelchair, funding for 24\/7 caregivers to enable me to pursue an education outside of my home country &#x2026; the list goes on. I had never spent more than a weekend away from my parents, so the greatest hurdle of all was trusting each other that I could do this independently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The desire to prove myself was ingrained in me from an early age, in part as a character trait and in part as a manifestation of my internalized ableism. For my life to have value, nothing I ever did could be mediocre. Studying in the U.S. was the ultimate symbol of overcoming my disability, and the fact that I got into Stanford was the icing on the cake.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">***<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With graduation only a few days away, I can confidently say that my time at Stanford has been extraordinary. But as is often the case, it has been so in the most unexpected of ways.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Academically, not only have I majored in a field that I never once considered prior to my sophomore year, but I have grown in my appreciation of knowledge for knowledge&#x2019;s sake rather than focusing on education as primarily a means to an end. I gradually learned that fulfillment would come from enrolling in classes that I actually wanted to take &#x2014; not those I felt I ought to &#x2014; and I ultimately carved out a learning experience that has been truly authentic to my passions. Most unexpectedly of all, I found myself in Oxford courtesy of BOSP and the COVID-19 pandemic, and it was there that I first began to believe in myself as a real scholar, discovering an academic niche that went on to shape the latter half of my Stanford experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the people I have been lucky enough to meet along the way, I would have to agree with the majority of students when they say that the people here are the best thing about Stanford. I arrived as a freshman craving social connection, but quickly realized that forming relationships was an evolving process that required me to step out of my comfort zone and tap into a vulnerability that I had been so averse to all my life. It wasn&#x2019;t just going to happen for me &#x2014; <em>even in America<\/em>. Despite this yearning for social bonds, I spent years convincing myself that I would be fine either way because I had goals that I was intent on achieving, but I now recognize wholeheartedly that when everything else is falling apart, my social ties and points of meaningful connection are what keep me afloat. I have found friendships that teach me new things about myself every day, and I am eternally grateful for their acceptance of me in all my strength and fragility. They have shown me that I bring value as a friend too, helping me drown out the voice that &#x2014; echoed by a society that sees people with disabilities as disabled first and human only second &#x2014; insists otherwise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, I came to Stanford seeking an escape from my disabled self, but in reality I have experienced the exact opposite. In some ways the everyday challenges of college life have brought my disability into sharper focus than ever before, and in certain moments I have found myself just longing for the ability to walk so that I would not have to spend another day facing institutional inaccessibility and &#x2014; you guessed it &#x2014; a lack of wheelchair accessible transport. What these moments have shown me, however, is that I can be more honest with myself about my experience with disability, and I hope that my writing today is a testament to that. Finding connection and belonging in the disability community at Stanford has encouraged me not to run from but to embrace this part of my identity, and I have learned to use advocacy for myself and others as a source of power. Despite my best intentions, Stanford has helped me grow into my disability, but I will leave this campus as a more complete version of myself because of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">***<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Graduation has come around far too quickly, and I have never been good at saying goodbye. I could write a book about the incredible experiences and opportunities that have defined my Stanford experience in so many unique and wonderful ways, but that&#x2019;s not what this column is about. At The Daily, writing about disability has been my &#x2018;thing,&#x2019; so, as a final farewell, I wanted to write candidly about how I have experienced Stanford &#x2014; from beginning to end &#x2014; through the lens of my disability. It certainly wasn&#x2019;t perfect, but looking back I hardly recognize my freshman self for all the best reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The page has turned and the next chapter is dawning &#x2014; onto sunny LA because this Cali girl isn&#x2019;t going anywhere! &#x2014; but as I leave this campus behind for now, I am most grateful to Stanford for showing me the true meaning of <em>extraordinary<\/em>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;Graduation has come around far too quickly, and I have never been good at saying goodbye,&#8221; writes Tilly Griffiths. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1002036,"featured_media":1205507,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[24],"tags":[567,19139,6687,5309,738,5268,78201],"site-layouts":[],"coauthors":[51801],"parsely":{"version":"1.1.0","meta":{"@context":"https:\/\/schema.org","@type":"NewsArticle","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/08\/griffiths-thanks-stanford-its-been-extraordinary\/"},"headline":"Griffiths | Thanks, Stanford.

You have always made sure to blaze your own trails, but I am so excited that we will both be able to call this wonderful, complicated place home. And I know Stanford is excited about the better Martinez-Krams.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The campus looks and feels so different now from when I first stepped onto campus as a student four years ago. There were no neighborhoods, masking guidelines or Barrillaga. My dorm, Freshman Sophomore College, no longer exists. When I was interviewed on a radio show before an Oregon State vs. Stanford baseball series, I could proudly say that The Stanford Daily was still a daily.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember telling you that I joined The Daily and how I won the lottery. Bobby Pragada &#x2019;19 pulled my name out of a hat, randomly placing me in the press box next to King Jemison &#x2019;21 for a Stanford football game day. I asked King what to wear, what to bring and how to write about Stanford&#x2019;s collapse against Utah, but the best advice I received that night came as we left the press conference and walked across the south end zone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Do you want a picture?&#x201D; King asked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;No, I&#x2019;m okay,&#x201D; I told him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Are you sure?&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Well, I guess.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The picture was on my Instagram story a few hours later and still serves as my Twitter cover photo. I stopped to smell the roses, commemorating what became my first of three seasons covering football for The Daily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I appreciated the moment when I announced women&#x2019;s soccer in North Carolina on KZSU 90.1 FM, as mommies texted me material to discuss during a 30-minute delay. I glowed when I interviewed <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2018\/11\/01\/preseason-qa-with-womens-basketball-head-coach-tara-vanderveer\/\">Tara VanDerveer<\/a> for the first time. I texted our family group chat in awe as soon as I finished my interview with <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2019\/04\/26\/final-at-manuel-ledecky-highlight-ninth-episode-of-laughter-permitted-with-julie-foudy\/\">Julie Foudy<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I faltered as well. I watched from the right field press area at Sunken Diamond during the NCAA regional tournament and envisioned returning to the spot in a year. I wish I had paused that moment. The pandemic wiped out the entire tournament, and I was back home living with you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is so easy to rush through college thinking of what is ahead. When taking out your pencil for a Monday morning lecture, it is easy to dream of a Friday afternoon nap. But if you rush through that week, you won&#x2019;t enjoy the Stern burrito bowls on Tuesday, the friend with a nice smile in your Wednesday morning section or the sunset over Hoover Tower on Thursday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It took me a while to grasp this, especially in my writing. You can read back through my early stories and know everything that happened on the field or the court, and nothing that happened outside the lines. Eventually, though, I began to capture the people in the story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2019\/05\/16\/from-the-farm-to-france-three-former-stanford-players-prepare-for-womens-world-cup\/\">Cybele Zhang and I<\/a> wrote about the Stanford players on the U.S. women&#x2019;s national team, and then you and I traveled to France and <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2019\/07\/06\/after-toppling-england-uswnt-to-play-netherlands-in-world-cup-finals\/\">your photograph<\/a> appeared in The Daily. I wrote about the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2021\/02\/27\/the-two-people-bringing-sound-to-maples\/\">people making noise<\/a> in a fan-less Maples Pavilion. I asked players, coaches and media members about Tara VanDerveer&#x2019;s <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/12\/14\/tara-vanderveer-history\/\">1,098 wins<\/a>. I told the story of the football team <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/12\/10\/football-practice-in-park\/\">practicing in the park<\/a>. I found <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/06\/03\/why-i-kneel\/\">my voice<\/a> amid tragedy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am so thankful for the many people who helped me outside The Daily. Nick Sako wrapped me with his parka when I was shivering from the postgame cold as I interviewed David Esquer &#x2019;87 in shorts and a short sleeve shirt. Janie McCauley and I shared desserts in empty arenas, as she shared tips about how to humanize my stories. Jacob Rayburn inspired me with his writing and understanding of an entire campus&#x2019;s worth of athletics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you know, I played club baseball at Stanford. Throughout my whole life, I wanted to end on a good swing whenever I practiced, and I would ask for &#x201C;one more&#x201D; until I got it. This year, I stopped asking for &#x201C;one more.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I looked at the calendar and realized this was my final year playing baseball. Instead of relying on &#x201C;one more&#x201D; swing to fix my mistakes, I treated every day on the field as my last.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, when I caught COVID and isolated while my team played in the regional tournament in Lancaster, I grieved having to follow along on GameChanger, but I knew that I made my last swing my best.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will never know when you will be doing something for the last time. You may go to TAP once a week until you spend your last dining dollars and never order another Pac-12 Burger. You will celebrate turning in your week 10 Math 51 problem set, knowing you will never take another math class. Once, I waved goodbye to sophomore year friends, not knowing the pandemic would delay our next hello by two years.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I learned to appreciate every moment. I am so excited about yours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Love,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Daniel<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Daniel Martinez-Krams reflects on learning to live in the moment. &#8220;It is so easy to rush through college thinking of what is ahead.

| Rituals"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>I took an extra long winter break this year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With classes moved online for the first few weeks of the quarter, I decided to stay home in Los Angeles. The extra time led me to looking through stacks and stacks of family photo albums, and one childhood photo of myself, in particular. I&#x2019;m two years old or so, wearing socks and sandals, standing in the yard at home and clutching the day&#x2019;s newspaper. Unfolded, the paper itself was probably as big as I was.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#x2019;t remember this precise photo being taken, but returning to the image nevertheless brought to mind a rush of other memories. Growing up, my Sunday mornings began with the LA Times. For as long as I can remember, my dad and I would head down Franklin Avenue to the neighborhood grocery store and pick up a copy of the weekend edition. (The rare occasion that I was able to pay for the newspaper myself with the spare quarters in my pocket made me feel very adult.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was our ritual. Coming home, newspaper in hand, and sitting around the dining table to read the sports section.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was home.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ritual, however, is probably not a word I would have used to describe this routine until I got to Stanford and realized just how impactful these Sunday mornings were. Last fall, I took ENGLISH 180A: &#8220;Periodicity&#8221; &#x2014; an early modern literature class that, among other topics, explores the inception of the English periodical in the eighteenth century. In one text that struck a particular cord with me, Kevis Goodman describes the ritualization of news consumption that envisions a routine mass ceremony, where readers look to the news each morning and night simultaneously. He writes, &#x201C;The significance of this mass ceremony &#x2014; [Georg Wilhelm Friedrich] Hegel observed that newspapers serve modern man as a substitute for morning prayers &#x2014; is paradoxical. It is performed in silent privacy, in the lair of the skull. Yet each communicant is well aware that the ceremony he performs is being replicated simultaneously by thousands (or millions) of others.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the same sort of communion that I had experienced growing up &#x2014; not just the action of reading itself, but the corresponding community and collective consciousness that it brought. Although, of course, the means of our news consumption continues to change into the 21st century, that very sentiment &#x2014; the mutual forging of reasoning and understanding among the public &#x2014; is what prompted me to join The Daily and what has kept me around for four years.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This ritual of news production and consumption, especially sports reporting, has spanned my entire Stanford experience and perhaps facilitated some of the most meaningful connections I&#x2019;ve made.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before even enrolling as a student, The Stanford Daily brought me community. In a makeshift high school reunion over Admit Weekend, Sarah Wishingrad (then a graduating Stanford senior) encouraged me to join The Daily, recounting on Meyer Green her own fond memories over the past four years.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward five months, and Bobby Pragada was enthusiastically convincing me to choose the sports section over a table at the activities fair.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And soon enough I had found a new, just as meaningful, ritual.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of reading about USC football with my parents, it was editing Jack Golub&#x2019;s column with him in Soto at 2 a.m., attending midweek football press conferences and walking to Treehouse to pick up pizza for production. Most nights, the routine, however, was just arguing that we print a sports article on the front page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without Claire Wang&#x2019;s willingness to take a chance on me as a freshman managing editor, I probably would not have bonded with my roommate in the same depth. My roommate played varsity lacrosse (a sport totally foreign to this Angeleno), so when tasked with editing coverage of the Stanford team, I asked her to explain the ins and outs of the sports she loved. Those conversations, with me sitting on my bed and her across the narrow dorm room on hers, or similar ones with my student-athlete friends Mason Gonzalez and Allie Jones, among others, brought us all closer over the course of the school year. Through these friendships, I forged another layer of my Stanford routine.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing and editing, especially as I assimilated to Stanford during my freshman year, gave me a sense of purpose, focus and community &#x2014; both within and beyond 456 Panama Mall. As a leader in a traditionally male section and traditionally male field at-large, perhaps the most important personal takeaway of working as a sports journalist and editor was harnessing my voice. Often the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/12\/21\/zhang-the-boys-club\/\">only woman in the room<\/a> (and probably the youngest, too), I had to advocate for myself and what I believed in. Perhaps that was construed as being insubordinate at times, but I would like to think that my presence and efforts helped other women carve out their own places in the sports journalism world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The necessity of speaking out and writing&#x2019;s potential to prompt change became especially apparent during my coverage of <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/11\/22\/36-sports-strong\/\">36 Sports Strong <\/a>and, in particular, the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/07\/13\/sports-game-point-1\/\">men&#x2019;s volleyball team&#x2019;s <\/a>efforts to save their program. Speaking to players and alumni showed me in practice the way that journalism could bring people together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But hearing about the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/07\/08\/sports-cancellations\/\">intended cuts<\/a>, simultaneous to sports around the country being put on hold <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/08\/11\/sports-football-cancelled\/\">due to the pandemic<\/a>, also made me realize how devastated I would be if a team\/club\/organization that I cared about was suddenly defunct or out of reach. More than anything, it made me appreciate the people, routines and laughs that The Daily has brought me. I&#x2019;ll take those memories with me, like the childhood photo albums, long after I leave this university &#x2014; freshman year autograph sessions after my full-page graphic on the baseball team and muddy Ink Bowl Games and headline games and Zoom Kahoots and breaking down Pac-12 football in EVGR with Daniel Martinez-Krams and interviews outside Jimmy V&#x2019;s with Zach Zafran and weekends at the beach with Tammer Bagdasarian and Cooper Veit and Drew Silva&#x2019;s NFL jerseys as we wait for TAP on Draft Day and FloVolleyball games with Madeline Grabb and trivia nights with Benjamin Zaidel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I decided at the start of my senior year that I would save a printed copy of each week&#x2019;s Stanford Daily so that, by graduation in June, I would have a journalistic record of my final year on campus. So, in packing up my undergraduate dorm room for the final time, I find myself in an oddly familiar position. Like the photograph from 20 years ago, I stand with an armful of newspapers, ready for whatever&#x2019;s next.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cybele Zhang discusses the rituals she&#8217;s found at Stanford. &#8220;Before even enrolling as a student, The Stanford Daily brought me community.

last August, I was underwhelmed. Like Lorde <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/08\/03\/arts\/music\/lorde-solar-power.html\">herself<\/a>, I had expected this release to be a &#x201C;big acid record&#x201D; &#x2014; showing up the synth angst of &#x201C;Pure Heroine&#x201D; and the museum magic of &#x201C;Melodrama&#x201D; with the shock and awe of a meteor shower.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, we got a first single that many found fitting for a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AbeoRobinson\/status\/1435770964516638722\">tampon commercial<\/a>. The intense instrumental breakdowns of tracks like &#x201C;Glory and Gore&#x201D; and &#x201C;Supercut&#x201D; were replaced by a leisurely 12-string guitar and a voice like farmer&#x2019;s market honey. Like its eponymous song, &#x201C;Solar Power&#x201D; instead turned out something like a &#x201C;weed album.&#x201D; It was playful. Meandering. Mild, even.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some complained that they were still too caught up in their &#x201C;Melodrama&#x201D; eras to appreciate this album, I felt like I hadn&#x2019;t even gotten past &#x201C;Pure Heroine.&#x201D; I was the overgrown suburban child who still drank orange juice and cried about growing up. Meanwhile, a 25-year-old Kiwi was telling me to get a grip. Not every song had to strike you to the bone, not every day would feel like cataclysm and not every day was a tick on a time bomb. Most of the time, Lorde seemed to say, life wasn&#x2019;t so extreme.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the kind of intense person who could never quite land the &#x201C;cool girl&#x201D; act, it was hard for me to learn to be temperate. I&#x2019;d long been familiar with debilitating grief, totalizing sadness, all-consuming infatuation; but I didn&#x2019;t know the grey emotions, the stretches between those poles.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, I spent a lot of time in grey.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scholarships I&#x2019;d poured every last drop of myself into seeped through my hands. People I&#x2019;d loved unconditionally established their conditions. Nothing on this campus felt the same as when we&#x2019;d left it, no matter how hard we tried to pretend we could refurbish a ghost town. But the sun stuck around a little longer. The music returned. It wasn&#x2019;t miraculous, but we found our footing again.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Granted, long-term memory and I aren&#x2019;t on the best of terms, but it&#x2019;s impossible to locate a few favorite senior year memories. It didn&#x2019;t feel like that&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;moments of sorrow, then moments of elation. It felt like ballooning into new spaces between all those words that used to classify then, now, later.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used to think that anything good had to be tumultuous. I wanted art to arrest me, and I wanted to feel <em>everything. <\/em>Senior year was supposed to pack all the punch of a swig of Italian liquor. Perhaps to spite me, it instead took notes from &#x201C;Solar Power,&#x201D; which I&#x2019;m now growing to love.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had spent so long curating chaos in my life to accommodate my obsessive need for melodrama, but as it turns out, resisting getting older gets old.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#x2019;s actually quite beautiful to realize that adolescent turbulence is not a prerequisite for feeling alive. You don&#x2019;t have to be fundamentally altered by something for it to be good for you. You don&#x2019;t have to seek catharsis in every sunset. You don&#x2019;t have to milk every second for what it&#x2019;s worth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#x2019;ve never claimed to be wise, and I certainly won&#x2019;t do so now. But if there&#x2019;s anything I wish I would&#x2019;ve understood sooner, it was that my life doesn&#x2019;t have to have a perpetual coming-of-age-film ethos to mean something. I&#x2019;m going to be &#x201C;becoming&#x201D; forever, long past the expiration dates the entertainment industry loves setting for women, and long past the lingering sense of loss I still feel now. I&#x2019;m going to experience as much stillness as I will tumultuousness, and both will matter.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I sat &#x2014; pen and pad in hand and seat heater on &#x2014; at my first San Francisco movie premiere freshman year, I remember thinking how surreal it was to be a student journalist. As I wobbled in a rickety swivel chair at the Daily building typing and retyping print headlines years later, I remember thinking the same thing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just because a moment isn&#x2019;t glamorous doesn&#x2019;t mean it won&#x2019;t glisten, and when I shuffle through my memories of this place, I see a luminous haze.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Malia Mendez reflects on her time at Stanford. &#8220;It\u2019s actually quite beautiful to realize that adolescent turbulence is not a prerequisite for feeling alive.

Despite receiving founding gifts totaling $1.7 billion, the school&#x2019;s incoming dean has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/05\/04\/climate\/john-doerr-stanford-climate.html\">indicated that<\/a> the school would still work with and accept funding from fossil fuel companies. This openness to fossil fuel funding is not hypothetical: the Doerr School is <a href=\"https:\/\/fossilfreeacademia.com\/bigoilentanglements\">currently slated to absorb<\/a> numerous fossil fuel-funded programs currently housed in the Stanford School of Earth. Such funding poses serious reputational risks to Stanford and the Doerr School, which might <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S221462962100476X?casa_token=4Jjiot_jMh8AAAAA:uQjdgsBx1DHDXcPW_MVJBlX210LfDvwuUHijypEWj2wmvZmDJAw-wUsUjG-nMFvukBdv-ONG_eM\">have its name used<\/a> to promote climate denial, greenwashing and policies that delay climate action. In response to this criticism, Dean Arun Majumdar <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.stanford.edu\/news\/message-arun-majumdar-looking-forward\">elaborated<\/a> that climate change requires an &#x201C;all hands on deck approach.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although this approach might appear reasonable, it would be prudent to verify whether fossil fuel companies are indeed honest deckhands or, instead, mutineers. After all, fossil fuel producers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.climatechangecommunication.org\/america-misled\/\">have known<\/a> about fossil-derived CO<sub>2<\/sub> emissions <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41558-018-0349-9\">since the 1950s<\/a>, and have denied or downplayed climate change <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1080\/09644016.2020.1863703\">since 1980<\/a>. In fact, the industry has used Stanford&#x2019;s name to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/12\/05\/opinion\/IHT-big-ambitions-at-stanford-a-global-climate-and-energy-project.html\">suggest<\/a> that fossil fuels are essential to sustain growth while avoiding economic disaster. Furthermore, in 2006, then-CEO of ExxonMobil Rex Tillerson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2006\/03\/30\/business\/the-new-face-of-an-oil-giant.html\">cited a $100 million contribution to Stanford&#x2019;s Global Climate and Energy Project<\/a> as evidence that the company is investing in renewable research, while ExxonMobil also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/11\/21\/us\/exxon-led-group-is-giving-a-climate-grant-to-stanford.html\">told investors<\/a> it would dedicate 1000 times more funds over the same time period to searching for new oil and gas reserves.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These seven decades of history are not lost on Dean Majumdar, who <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.stanford.edu\/news\/message-arun-majumdar-looking-forward\">proposes asking four questions<\/a> to suss out potential bad actors. In this article, we will answer these questions for Stanford&#x2019;s fossil fuel partners in order to further our shared goal of a truly sustainable Doerr School.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/truesustainabilityschool.com\/\">Coalition for a True School of Sustainability<\/a>, the University&#x2019;s known fossil fuel partners include: BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy, EcoPetrol, Eni, Equinor, ExxonMobil, JX Nippon (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.eneos.co.jp\/english\/company\/history\/\">since 2020<\/a>: ENEOS), Occidental, Petrobras, PetroChina, Phillips 66, Repsol, Saudi Aramco, Shell, SK Energy and Total. For simplicity, we will refer to these companies as Stanford&#x2019;s &#x201C;Partners.&#x201D; Stanford <a href=\"https:\/\/truesustainabilityschool.com\/bigoilentanglements\">also engages with<\/a> the American Petroleum Institute, a national oil and gas trade association, as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/truesustainabilityschool.com\/paris\">several other fossil-related firms<\/a> not included here.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wherever possible, we will characterize Stanford&#x2019;s fossil-fuel Partners individually to <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.stanford.edu\/news\/message-arun-majumdar-looking-forward\">avoid painting the entire industry with the same brush<\/a>. This approach aligns with Stanford&#x2019;s Board of Trustees <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/2020\/06\/12\/trustees-commit-accelerating-transition-to-net-zero-greenhouse-gas-emissions\/\">2020 commitment to the Paris Agreement<\/a>: the Board eschews blanket fossil divestments, instead encouraging a case-by-case evaluation. With this in mind, we can address Dean Majumdar&#x2019;s four questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <em>Are [a Partner&#x2019;s] commitments aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/unfccc.int\/sites\/default\/files\/english_paris_agreement.pdf\">Paris Agreement<\/a> aims to limit the global average temperature increase to well below 2 &#xB0;C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to stay below 1.5 &#xB0;C. Stanford&#x2019;s fossil Partners do not appear to be committed to these goals: a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/10.1126\/science.abh0687\">2021 paper<\/a> in the journal <em>Science<\/em> analyzed Stanford&#x2019;s aforementioned Partners, concluding that only Occidental Petroleum comes close to meeting the Paris Goals. These findings are supported by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/ng-interactive\/2022\/may\/11\/fossil-fuel-carbon-bombs-climate-breakdown-oil-gas\">The Guardian<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/priceofoil.org\/2022\/05\/24\/big-oil-reality-check-2022\/\">Oil Change International<\/a>. Notably, Oil Change International found the climate pledges and plans of eight Stanford Partners to be &#x201C;grossly insufficient.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <em>Is [a Partner] devoting sufficient human and financial resources to meet its commitments?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To reiterate, most of Stanford&#x2019;s Partners&#x2019; commitments do not align with Paris goals. For these companies, any devoted human and financial resources are therefore insufficient by default. This point is underscored by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.climateaction100.org\/whos-involved\/companies\/?search_companies&amp;company_sector=oil-and-gas\">Climate Action 100+<\/a>, which judges none of Stanford&#x2019;s Partners Capital Alignment as &#x2018;aligned&#x2019;. <a href=\"https:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0263596\">A 2022 scientific study<\/a> reproduces these conclusions for BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell, stating that none of these companies are &#x201C;currently on the way to a clean energy transition.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. <em>Is [a Partner] supporting and promoting government policy that would create the business imperative for a transition to a clean economy?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To answer this question, it would be easy to cherry pick negative examples of fossil-fuel lobbying. This would seemingly disqualify ExxonMobil for <a href=\"https:\/\/influencemap.org\/report\/An-InfluenceMap-Note-ExxonMobil-Lobbies-the-EU-Commission-add01200dc694b00e9ac4bebf660227b\">lobbying<\/a> against the European Union&#x2019;s CO<sub>2<\/sub> vehicle standards, and Shell, BP, Equinor and Total for <a href=\"https:\/\/influencemap.org\/pressrelease\/EU-Green-Deal-at-Risk-from-Pro-Gas-Lobbying-17523\">promoting fossil gas<\/a> in Europe: these obstructive actions <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.stanford.edu\/news\/message-arun-majumdar-looking-forward\">conflict with Dean Majumdar&#x2019;s personal beliefs<\/a>. However, it might be more objective to judge companies for their overall lobbying behavior. To this end, <a href=\"https:\/\/ca100.influencemap.org\/index.html\">LobbyMap<\/a> lists the lobbying behavior of Stanford&#x2019;s fossil fuel Partners. It finds most of these Partners to obstruct climate policy and five Partners to express mixed positions. Notably, LobbyMap considers the American Petroleum Institute to be &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/lobbymap.org\/influencer\/American-Petroleum-Institute-API\/projectlink\/American-Petroleum-Institute-API-In-Climate-Change\">broadly hostile to climate policy in the US<\/a>.&#x201D; The Institute counts multiple Stanford Partners among its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.api.org\/membership\/members\">members<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.stanford.edu\/news\/message-arun-majumdar-looking-forward\">according to Dean Majumdar<\/a>, a company sometimes needs to &#x201C;produce oil and gas to avoid significant disruptions to human welfare, the economy and national security in the short term.&#x201D; In this case, one should ask:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>4. Does it still intend to meet its climate commitments in the long term?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, Dean Majumdar suggests that exceptional circumstances might justify temporarily increased fossil fuel production if producers still commit to long-term climate goals. Evaluating this question, we can assess how fossil fuel companies act during the Covid-19 pandemic or Russia&#x2019;s (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.iea.org\/reports\/russian-supplies-to-global-energy-markets\/oil-market-and-russian-supply-2\">#3 global oil producer<\/a>) invasion of Ukraine. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/influencemap.org\/\">Influence Map<\/a>, the American Petroleum Institute has used <a href=\"https:\/\/influencemap.org\/report\/The-Coronavirus-Crisis-and-Climate-Lobbying-23249d39450ff19b441090a6a50174eb\">both<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/influencemap.org\/pressrelease\/US-Oil-Gas-Sector-Used-Ukraine-to-Push-Expansion-19093\">crises<\/a> to lobby for rolling back existing or planned climate policy standards: these are not good signs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, it appears like Dean Majumdar&#x2019;s <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.stanford.edu\/news\/message-arun-majumdar-looking-forward\">questions<\/a> have no positive answers. This is not to say that no well-intentioned people work at or with Stanford&#x2019;s fossil fuel Partners: we personally know many such people. However, we must also recognize that the overall behavior of Stanford&#x2019;s Partners appears inconsistent with Dean Majumdar&#x2019;s criteria and the Board of Trustees&#x2019; commitments to the Paris Agreement.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Stanford engages with these Partners at an institutional level, it should therefore consider the risks. Should Stanford expose itself to what <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S221462962100476X?casa_token=4Jjiot_jMh8AAAAA:uQjdgsBx1DHDXcPW_MVJBlX210LfDvwuUHijypEWj2wmvZmDJAw-wUsUjG-nMFvukBdv-ONG_eM\">researchers describe<\/a> as greenwashing and ideological climate denialism? Does Stanford intend to help fossil-fuel companies <a href=\"https:\/\/truesustainabilityschool.com\/bigoilentanglements\">explore unconventional oil<\/a>, even though the IEA <a href=\"https:\/\/www.iea.org\/reports\/net-zero-by-2050\">deems further oil exploration incompatible<\/a> with net-zero goals? Both Stanford and the Doerr School should weigh these questions carefully.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, the research cited here suggests that Stanford&#x2019;s current fossil-fuel Partners do not even remotely match Dean Majumdar&#x2019;s criteria and the Board of Trustees&#x2019; Paris commitment. Although our concerns with fossil-fuel engagement <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/05\/12\/from-the-community-stanford-has-a-chance-at-a-real-school-of-sustainability-if-it-refuses-fossil-fuel-meddling\/\">extend beyond<\/a> merely meeting these requirements, discussing these concerns might be more appropriate once the Dean&#x2019;s and Board&#x2019;s minimum criteria are met.

The White Coat Ceremony marks the start of our training as future physicians. Held annually before the beginning of the first quarter, the ceremony is a time for students to celebrate the start of their medical career with friends and family and enjoy a nice meal courtesy of Stanford catering. At our ceremony, however, several of our classmates were unable to celebrate this occasion over dinner with our loved ones. As we approached the food station after the ceremony, we found that there were no dinner options left for vegetarians.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, insufficient vegetarian options are not a rare occurrence at Stanford events. Throughout our first year here, we have attended lunch seminars, dinner seminars, orientations, club meetings and other events where the food options for vegetarians were limited or nonexistent. Not only does a lack of vegetarian options mean that our cultural or moral commitments are not recognized, but it also means that we are unable to choose a food option that reduces our impact on the environment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having spent my [Akshay&#8217;s] entire life on the East Coast, I had never heard of the abbreviation AQI (air quality index) until coming to Stanford. During my first few weeks on campus, I found myself googling &#x201C;Palo Alto AQI&#x201D; nearly every morning as I saw the smog from forest fires floating over campus. The haze was not very different from the smog I had seen in Beijing during a trip a few years ago. In fact, the AQI in Palo Alto sometimes exceeds that of Beijing, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/jamesconca\/2018\/08\/23\/the-ten-most-polluted-cities-on-earth\/?sh=4ffc89ef18cc\">one of the most polluted cities in the world<\/a>. Stanford is already doing a lot to address climate change, from its <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability-year-in-review.stanford.edu\/2015\/snapshots\/marguerite-fleet-increases-electric-buses\/\">electric shuttle buses<\/a>, to <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability-year-in-review.stanford.edu\/2021\/\">departmental carbon emissions goals<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability-year-in-review.stanford.edu\/2016\/snapshots\/seven-rde-student-housing-residences-convert-to-green-cleaning\/\">eco-friendly cleaning solutions<\/a>. Why can&#x2019;t we adopt a similar environmentally conscious approach when it comes to food?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The evidence is clear that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/d41586-019-02409-7\">plant-based diets are generally more environmentally friendly than non-vegetarian diets<\/a>. In fact, the UN IPCC report indicates we could reduce greenhouse emissions by six gigatons a year (or 16.5% of total emissions) if everyone reduced their meat intake to once a month, and eight gigatons (or 22% of total emissions) if everyone completely stopped eating meat. Plant-based meals are typically cheaper than meat-based meals and would save money for Stanford and its dining services if implemented at scale. Plant-based meals are also more inclusive because non-vegetarians can typically eat vegetarian, but not the other way around. Non-vegetarians may even prefer to eat vegetarian depending on the options available. In fact, at our White Coat Ceremony, the shortage of vegetarian meals happened because non-vegetarians snatched up the limited number of vegetarian meals before the vegetarians could (we don&#x2019;t blame them &#x2014; those enchiladas looked good!). Similarly, as the cost and taste of plant-based meat substitutes approaches those of regular meat we hope to ameliorate meat-lovers&#x2019; concerns of compromising on the flavors and textures they know and love.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are ways to encourage plant-based dining habits without alienating those who prefer meat-based options. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8014907\/\">One effective approach<\/a> is &#x201C;default vegetarianism,&#8221; in which vegetarian meals are the default option and non-vegetarian meals must be explicitly requested. This method opposes the status quo, where vegetarians must specially request a plant-based meal because the default option is typically meat-based. In a default vegetarian world, everyone can eat whatever they want, but folks are nudged toward choosing the more environmentally friendly option. Opt-out strategies, like default vegetarianism, have been <a href=\"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jpubhealth\/article\/43\/2\/392\/5637580\">successful in diverse settings<\/a>, including raising organ donation rates, encouraging healthy decision making and even increasing philanthropic donations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach is not unheard of at Stanford. Pockets of the Law School, School of Earth Sciences and Business School are vegetarian by default, if not completely vegetarian. There are also the <a href=\"https:\/\/defaultveg.org\/\">DefaultVeg<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/gfi.org\/the-alt-protein-project\/\">AltProtein<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/rde.stanford.edu\/dining\/one-plate-one-planet\">One Plate, One Planet<\/a> movements, which aim to encourage sustainable plant-based eating habits across Stanford. As we expand access to plant-based meals, the quality of Stanford catering&#x2019;s vegetarian meals will only improve.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food sustainability is a complex and nuanced issue. A rigorous approach to sustainable food practices may consider whether or not food is locally sourced, what type of farm produces the food, how far the food travels from where it was produced to Stanford, etc. We must be thoughtful about how we encourage climate-conscious food, but there are steps in the right direction that we can take immediately. While <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/heres-how-much-food-contributes-to-climate-change\/\">not all plant-based foods have a low climate footprint<\/a>, it is clear that on average, plant-based diets are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pcrm.org\/good-nutrition\/vegan-diet-environment#:~:text=A%20plant%2Dbased%20diet%20can,beans%E2%80%94help%20protect%20the%20planet.\">more environmentally friendly<\/a> than animal-based diets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stanford can continue to strive for a campus environment that is sustainable, inclusive and tasty for all students by learning from those in our community who are already taking a thoughtful approach to sustainable food practices. As medical school acceptances were released earlier this month, we hope that the incoming class of students can look forward to a delicious plant-based meal to share with their friends and family at the next White Coat Ceremony.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Akshay Swaminathan and Wasan Kumar argue that Stanford should better support plant-based dining habits. &#8220;The evidence is clear that plant-based diets are generally more environmentally friendly than non-vegetarian diets.

Under <a href=\"https:\/\/leginfo.legislature.ca.gov\/faces\/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB481\">Assembly Bill 481,<\/a> law enforcement agencies are required to receive approval from their local governing body for the acquisition and continued use of military equipment. Among the military items and uses that the Sheriff&#x2019;s Office wants approved are: continued use of 280 Colt AR-15 and other assault and sniper rifles, a new $465,000 robot (on top of the three robots already in inventory) and unrestricted use of &#x201C;less lethal&#x201D; (i.e. rubber bullets) and chemical munitions, according to the meeting <a href=\"http:\/\/sccgov.iqm2.com\/Citizens\/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?Frame=&amp;MeetingID=14423&amp;MediaPosition=&amp;ID=111219&amp;CssClass=\">agenda<\/a>. This list does not include the inventory within the Stanford University Department of Public Safety&#x2019;s (SUDPS) possession.<strong> <\/strong>According to the agenda, <strong>SUDPS alone has 32 Colt AR-15 rifles and eight Defense Technology 40mm Launchers for &#x201C;less lethal&#x201D; munitions, among other items.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) pointed out during the meeting, these types of militarized equipment do not keep communities safe: they exacerbate the threat posed to Black and Brown communities due to already existing disparities in policing, and they do not keep communities safe. Studies show that they fail to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41562-020-00995-5\">reduce crime<\/a> and\/or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/doi\/10.1073\/pnas.1805161115\">attacks on police<\/a>, but that they <em>do <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/2053168017712885\">increase<\/a> the <a href=\"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/1065912918784209\">amount of violence<\/a> communities face at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aclu.org\/report\/war-comes-home-excessive-militarization-american-police\">hands of police.<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AFSC also pointed out that the Sheriff&#x2019;s Office proposed Military Equipment Use Policy violates state and county law. <a href=\"https:\/\/leginfo.legislature.ca.gov\/faces\/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB48\">Assembly Bill 48<\/a> prohibits the use of kinetic energy projectiles (i.e. &#x201C;less lethal&#x201D; munitions) and chemical agents to disperse any assembly, protest or demonstration except under very specific circumstances (such as threat to life or of severe bodily injury). And perhaps most importantly, the Military Equipment Use Policy places few to no restrictions on its use of militarized equipment. There are no explicit prohibitions on use of any of these items, nor are there real limitations (most uses are defined as &#x201C;including, but not limited to&#x201D;).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these deficiencies and community concerns, the Sheriff&#x2019;s Office argued that this military equipment is needed to respond to incidents like the 2021 VTA shooting in San Jose. Indeed, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thenation.com\/article\/society\/derecka-purnell-becoming-abolitionists\/\">police often invoke<\/a> mass shootings as a justification for their militarization, as well as their very existence. Unfortunately, in the past few weeks, we&#x2019;ve seen multiple times just how empty the promise of safety through militarized police forces truly is. In Uvalde, TX, a gunman killed 19 children and two adults at a local elementary school. It&#x2019;s difficult to imagine a more disastrous police response: the gunman was inside the school for around <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/2022\/05\/27\/texas-school-shooting-uvalde-gunman-timeline\">80 minutes,<\/a> roughly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2022\/05\/27\/us\/uvalde-shooting-police-response-timeline\/index.html\">50 of which<\/a> involved 19 police officers waiting inside a school hallway, refusing to confront the lone gunman. Federal marshals and Uvalde Police Department officers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-us-canada-61604652\">reserved their violence<\/a> for family members urging action: one woman was briefly handcuffed, a father was thrown to the ground by an officer, another was pepper-sprayed and another was tasered. Meanwhile, students trapped inside made at least <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/05\/27\/us\/texas-shooting-911-call-press-conference.html?smid=url-share\">seven 911 calls<\/a> begging police &#x2014; who they could hear right outside &#x2014; for help. Ultimately, it took a separate law enforcement agency <strong>receiving a key from a school janitor <\/strong>before the gunman was killed and children were able to leave.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The knee-jerk response to tragedies like this is to call for more police funding. But that would make a mockery of the people who lost loved ones in recent weeks in the face of police incompetence. Uvalde spends <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nydailynews.com\/news\/politics\/us-elections-government\/ny-aoc-texas-school-shooting-money-law-enforcement-20220526-h5qllrucmjanrj4kxrikedw3q4-story.html\">40% of its budget<\/a> on police and has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/us-news\/uvalde-texas-school-shooting-security-plan-rcna30568\">more than doubled<\/a> the amount it spends on school policing since 2017, from roughly $200,000 to $435,000. In Buffalo, NY, a 911 dispatcher <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/nation\/2022\/05\/19\/buffalo-shooting-911-dispatcher-suspended\/\">hung up the phone<\/a> on an employee trapped in the grocery store attacked by a white supremacist gunman. New York City <a href=\"https:\/\/gothamist.com\/news\/nyc-will-add-250-more-nypd-officers-patrol-subway-system\">increased<\/a> the amount of law enforcement dedicated to the subway system by 250 officers last May, only for the <a href=\"https:\/\/nyunews.com\/opinion\/2022\/04\/18\/nypd-incompetent-subway-shooting-cut-funding\/\">NYPD to fail<\/a> to prevent the attack or apprehend the gunman.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have <a href=\"https:\/\/itsgoingdown.org\/militarized-law-enforcement-dont-protect-us-from-mass-shooters\/\">decades&#x2019; worth<\/a> of similar examples of police failure in the context of mass shootings. We also know that in the two years since George Floyd was murdered, police have gone to kill over <a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/6180605\/minneapolis-police-reform-george-floyd-murder\/\">2,000 more people<\/a>, or about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2022\/mar\/30\/us-police-killing-people-high-rates\">three people per day.<\/a> Whether we want to admit it or not, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/news\/daily-comment\/seeing-america-again-in-the-texas-elementary-school-shooting\">we are living in a death cult<\/a>, in no small part due to this country&#x2019;s obsession with police. As writer, lawyer and activist Derecka Purnell writes in &#8220;Becoming Abolitionists,&#8221; &#x201C;[S]tructural violence, like militarism and policing, can create and shape interpersonal violence, like assaults, murders and mass shootings . . . . Plainly put, when the federal government uses law enforcement and the military to control concentrated wealth, property and natural resources, they condition everyday people to accept the violence, replicate it or rebel against it.&#x201D; We must be among those who rebel against it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We must work to end policing, war and militarization here and around the globe.

More than 130 years ago, a Chinese man named Jim Mok and a team of Chinese gardeners employed by the Stanfords labored together to plant the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2010\/02\/18\/rooted-in-history\/\">166 palm trees<\/a> that would one day become emblematic of the University.<sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, hundreds of Chinese workers also leveled the terrain, laid building foundations and set up other vital physical infrastructure (including the subterranean <a href=\"https:\/\/stanfordsteamtunnels.wordpress.com\/\">steam tunnels<\/a>) needed for a functioning university campus.<sup>2<\/sup> More than 100 of these workers were <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1080\/00447471.2019.1611344?needAccess=true\">still employed<\/a> in the 1890s, when the <a href=\"https:\/\/125.stanford.edu\/commencement\/\">first students<\/a> matriculated and graduated.<sup>3<\/sup> The fascinating history of Chinese laborers on campus has been unearthed by a dedicated <a href=\"https:\/\/archaeology.stanford.edu\/researchfaculty-projects\/arboretum-chinese-labor-quarters-project\">group of Stanford archaeologists<\/a> working at the Arboretum archaeological site on campus, yet their stories (like too many others) remain largely unknown to students, faculty and alumni &#x2014; and as a result, uncelebrated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is time for the University to definitively acknowledge the contributions of Chinese Americans in its founding and most formative years. We are grateful to the faculty and student researchers who have meticulously documented many of these stories, but it is the University&#x2019;s responsibility as an institution to publicize this history both within the Stanford community and in the public sphere. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From its inception, Stanford University has benefited from the contributions of Asian Americans, including these unsung Chinese workers. Even so, the institution&#x2019;s relationship with Chinese Americans in particular has been anything but straightforward. As the United States concludes its annual celebration of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefing-room\/presidential-actions\/2022\/04\/29\/a-proclamation-on-asian-american-native-hawaiian-and-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2022\/\">Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month<\/a>, it is appropriate to pause and critically examine Stanford&#x2019;s complicated legacy &#x2014; that of Leland Stanford Sr. <em>the man<\/em>, as well as <em>the institution<\/em> he and his wife Jane founded to honor their son, Leland Jr.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leland Stanford Sr. amassed his vast fortune by presiding over the Central Pacific Railroad, as one of the Big Four <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/in-1975-stanford-voted-to-have-its-mascot-be-the-robber-barons-2016-6\">robber barons<\/a> leading the organization. <a href=\"http:\/\/web.stanford.edu\/group\/chineserailroad\/cgi-bin\/website\/\">Chinese laborers<\/a>, primarily from Guangdong, constituted 90% of the company&#x2019;s workforce. They were often assigned the most dangerous work, such as setting off explosives and digging tunnels through unyielding granite.<sup>4<\/sup> When the <a href=\"http:\/\/web.stanford.edu\/group\/chineserailroad\/cgi-bin\/website\/\">transcontinental railroad<\/a> that linked the nation&#x2019;s two coasts was completed in 1869, it was largely due to these workers&#x2019; blood, sweat and tears, despite <a href=\"https:\/\/www.history.com\/news\/transcontinental-railroad-chinese-immigrants\">being compensated significantly less<\/a> than white laborers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet as Professor Gordon Chang <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1080\/00447471.2019.1611344?needAccess=true\">describes<\/a>, Leland Stanford&#x2019;s attitude toward the Chinese was &#x201C;tense, ambivalent and complex.&#x201D;<sup>5<\/sup> Stanford the politician pandered to nativists and embraced anti-Chinese hate as a matter of political expediency. In his <a href=\"https:\/\/governors.library.ca.gov\/addresses\/08-Stanford.html\">inaugural speech<\/a> as Governor of California in January 1862, he said:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>&#8220;To my mind it is clear, that the settlement among us of an inferior race is to be discouraged by every legitimate means. Asia, with her numberless millions, sends to our shores the dregs of her population. &#x2026; There can be no doubt but that the presence among us of numbers of degraded and distinct people must exercise a deleterious influence upon the superior race, and to a certain extent, repel desirable immigration.&#8221;<sup>6<\/sup><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Within a couple years, Stanford&#x2019;s own Central Pacific Railroad Company would be hiring the same despised Chinese labor. Through interactions with his employees, Stanford revised his earlier opinions of the Chinese and admitted that they were intelligent, hardworking and loyal servants.<sup>7<\/sup> Yet as a newly elected U.S. Senator from California, he spoke to Congress in support of additional legislation to curtail the Chinese presence in America, declaring, &#x201C;Chinamen have played an important part in the development of that section of the country by the work they have done in the building up of railroads and in other improvements, as well as manufactures; but the limit of their usefulness has been reached. &#x200B;&#x200B;Not only should no more be allowed to come into the country, but those now here should be gradually returned.&#x201D;<sup>8<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This ambivalence manifested throughout his politics, as he publicly called for federal restrictions on Chinese immigration, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1080\/00447471.2019.1611344?needAccess=true\">endorsed<\/a> the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act barring Chinese laborers from immigrating to the United States and <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2019\/05\/23\/chinese-railroad-workers\/\">affirmed<\/a> the 1892 Geary Act extending these restrictions.<sup>9<\/sup> At the same time, Chinese workers operated and maintained his family <a href=\"https:\/\/sf.curbed.com\/maps\/railroad-whales-were-richer-than-you-could-ever-hope-to-be\">properties<\/a>, including a <a href=\"https:\/\/ohp.parks.ca.gov\/ListedResources\/Detail\/642\">vineyard<\/a>, the Stanford <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/1215385\">mansion<\/a> atop San Francisco&#x2019;s Nob Hill (at the time, the &#x201C;<a href=\"http:\/\/berkeleyheritage.com\/berkeley_landmarks\/good_shepherd.html\">largest private residence<\/a>&#x201D; in the state) and the Palo Alto <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/features\/2014\/year-in-review\/spotlight\/cantor.html\">stock farm<\/a> that eventually became the campus of Stanford University.<sup>10<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this period when anti-Chinese hatred festered in the country, Leland and Jane Stanford did what they could to protect their Chinese employees from outside intimidation and harassment. They even leased some of their land to workers like Jim Mok, who used it to cultivate and sell chrysanthemums to students to earn a bit of extra income. For the Big Game of 1895, a profusion of &#x201C;football mums&#x201D; colored the stands. Stanford students wore large, festive chrysanthemums in red hues pinned to their jackets, while Cal students wore yellow ones, creating a tradition that endured for decades to come.<sup>11<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since its early days, Stanford University has <a href=\"https:\/\/exhibits.stanford.edu\/stanford-stories\/feature\/1890s\">admitted<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/pr\/94\/940621Arc4199.html\">Japanese<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/searchworks.stanford.edu\/catalog?f%5Bcollection%5D%5B%5D=8667913\">Chinese<\/a> students. But this admission was often met with overt racism, reminding us that entrance to an elite institution does not equate to inclusion. When a Chinese freshman attempted to move into the dorms at Encina Hall in 1918, he was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sapaac.org\/s\/Yu_Chinese_Student_Encina.jpeg\">bodily thrown out<\/a> by white students. The outraged Chinese community rallied to fund the construction of a<em> <\/em>clubhouse on campus, where Chinese students could live while studying at Stanford. Chinese students and members of the Chinese business community worked together to buy a house on campus and rebuild it. Originally located on Salvatierra, where the Stanford Law School stands today, the Chinese Clubhouse was torn down in 1971 to make way for more University construction. Just as much of Asian American history has been papered over, the community&#x2019;s tangible heritage on campus was demolished.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Asian American alumni, we look upon Stanford with great affection; yet we must also recall the challenges and injustices the AAPI community has overcome to be part of the University. Recognizing past wrongs, while uncovering and celebrating powerful stories of resilience, is not an indictment of our alma mater. Rather, it is a long-overdue reckoning &#x2014; and an opportunity to initiate healing and forge a stronger sense of collective history. One welcome step would be the installation of a sign on campus to commemorate this history and ensure that it is readily accessible to students, alumni and visitors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crucially, we believe that any act commemorating the Chinese in America is also necessarily an act of reconciliation. Thus, <em>the process undertaken<\/em> is just as important as the end result. This process should be founded on meaningful consultation and active participation of the community being represented. We ask the University to engage with our community and empower us to be co-authors of our own story. Such an approach represents best practices for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nps.gov\/civic\/index.html\">national parks<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sitesofconscience.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/Members_member-Benefits_005.pdf\">historical landmarks<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/sarweb.org\/blog-guidelines-for-collaboration-museums-and-communities-seeking-equitable-change\/\">museums<\/a> across the country and embraces the ethos: <a href=\"https:\/\/artmuseumteaching.com\/2017\/08\/28\/culture-lab-manifesto\/\"><em>Nothing about us, without us.<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stanford administrators can take inspiration from numerous past initiatives honoring Chinese American workers: the Chinese Historical Society of America&#x2019;s plaque <a href=\"https:\/\/chsa.org\/2014\/05\/chsas-history-comes-full-circle-with-chinese-railroad-worker-honors\/\">commemorating<\/a> their critical contribution to the first transcontinental railroad; <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1-nySQ5qadG0sxg4wZKuxctzHZ2m0pfZfx05Q7lI26Ag\/edit?usp=sharing\">other markers<\/a><em> <\/em>honoring the Chinese around North America, with text crafted by our communities in both English and <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1-nySQ5qadG0sxg4wZKuxctzHZ2m0pfZfx05Q7lI26Ag\/edit?usp=sharing\">Traditional Chinese<\/a>; or Stanford&#x2019;s own <a href=\"https:\/\/marketstreet.stanford.edu\">Market Street Chinatown Archaeological Project<\/a> in San Jose, led by Archaeology Center Director Barbara Voss.

If justice, equity, diversity and inclusion truly <a href=\"https:\/\/ideal.stanford.edu\/\">matter to Stanford<\/a>, as Provost Persis Drell asserts, then the University must strive to genuinely engage with the Chinese American community in bringing this history to light.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We urge University leaders to prioritize inclusion and to co-create with communities of color. Avoid tokenistic engagement that does not truly involve communities on matters important to them. Partner with civic groups to develop these narratives into innovative heritage experiences.

in 2016. He co-founded an insurtech startup and now lives in Miami, Fla. Ned Chambers received his B.S. in human biology in 1973. He recently retired from a neighborhood family medical practice in San Diego. Neither belonged to a housed fraternity while at Stanford.<\/em><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In her opinion <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/04\/27\/from-the-community-dear-admin-we-know-you-dont-work-for-us\/\">piece<\/a> published Apr. 27, former undergraduate Alex Young (a founding member of Abolish Stanford Greek) questions why only Greek organizations deserve campus housing over what she contends are 650+ open membership clubs on campus. Her suggestion is that because members of these other organizations do not have the option to stay multiple years in their residences, nobody should have that option. We argue that instead of ending this option for the fewer than 500 students who now benefit, it should be expanded to all students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Acknowledging a housing shortage, the original row houses were built by Greek alumni to meet a severe housing shortage for undergraduates. In response, alumni raised what would be tens of millions in today&#x2019;s dollars to assist the University in housing undergraduates. The organizations that did so raised funds that both increased the undergraduate housing supply and allowed the organization&#x2019;s students to be housed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 1960s, Greek alumni were approached again and encouraged to abandon their Row houses to build even more student housing on the Knoll and by Lake Lagunita. They were once again asked to be the principal funders of new undergraduate housing. One group, Sigma Chi (550 Lasuen), rejected the offer, but continues to maintain their own property under a lease with the University, paying a 6-figure ground lease rent and performed a multi-million dollar <a href=\"https:\/\/oac.cdlib.org\/findaid\/ark:\/13030\/kt0d5nf2mc\/entire_text\/\">renovation<\/a> in 2006.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ms. Young&#x2019;s proposed solution to what she perceives as an inequity is the opposite of what ought to be University policy. The real solution here is not taking away the option of multi-year housing from the fewer than 500 students in those residences; it is offering that type of housing to <em>all<\/em> students who want it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Ms. Young cites statistics that are several years old, this spring&#x2019;s rush tells us how dramatically undergraduate housing demand has increased in the years since Ms. Young was an undergraduate. As one example, over 435 Stanford men rushed fraternities this year, according to our conversations with the IFC. Only about 200 received bids. We estimate that less than half of them will be able to live in a Greek residence next year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorority rush this spring saw similar numbers. 396 students rushed sororities; 254 received bids. Demand was also way up for students rushing groups in the Multicultural Greek Council (MGC) and African-American Fraternal &amp; Sororal Association (AAFSA). Given strong demand, the University should find ways to add more Greek housing options rather than removing existing housing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Approximately a thousand students (versus a freshman class of 2,350) wanted to join Greek lettered organizations this spring. The housed Greek organizations draw the greatest interest. These students likely want to live in multi-year housing largely to develop the <a href=\"https:\/\/news.gallup.com\/opinion\/gallup\/173630\/fraternity-sorority-membership-linked-higher-college-grads.aspx\">closer<\/a> relationships and lifetime bonds <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npcwomen.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2037\/2017\/07\/gallup-purdue_index_-_fraternities_and_sororities_understanding_life_outcomes.pdf\">created<\/a> in such an environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on our assessment of housing capacity, we estimate that the 10 houses now assigned to Greek organizations can hold just under 500 students. This spring&#x2019;s rush suggests that there&#x2019;s demand for Greek housing by as many as 3300 students, given a spring rush of 831 multiplied by four class years. A more conservative estimate might put this number around 2500 &#x2014; still five times the available supply.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ms. Young contends that this dynamic is unfair. What she does not share, and presumably does not know, is that it is Greek alumni who for at least 15 years have lobbied the University to dramatically expand this housing option to all students. Given the lack of similar housing options for non-Greek students, it is evidently the Office of Student Affairs that stubbornly <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2018\/05\/16\/a-history-of-housing-shortages-how-the-university-accommodates-consistent-growth\/\">resists<\/a> doing so. The University should be meeting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/silicon-valley-housing-crisis-ensnares-stanford-11555254001\">demand<\/a> by either increasing the supply of Greek residences or letting all other student organizations and students have an opportunity to live in an expanded pool of similar residences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of placing blame with the Office of Student Affairs, Ms. Young contends there is &#x201C;only one explanation for all this: donor influence.&#x201D; She claims it is &#x201C;well known that Greek alumni donate more to their universities than non-Greek alumni.&#x201D; She asserts that Greek alumni tend to be the &#x201C;wealthiest and the most powerful alumni.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether Ms. Young&#x2019;s claim that the University&#x2019;s most successful alumni are Greek is accurate or not, it is undisputed that Greek alumni do contribute significantly more at most schools, including Stanford. There is a reason. Ms. Young&#x2019;s linked documents establish that students in Greek life are more likely to say they formed relationships with mentors and professors, were more active in extracurricular activities and had better access to internships. All of these positive outcomes are the necessary by-product of the relationships and lifetime bonds that are created by living with a diverse group of roughly 50 individuals from different class years for multiple years in the <em>same<\/em> Stanford residence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alumni who strongly bond with their university as a student will be more bonded as an alum. They volunteer more. They give more. Stanford would do a service to all its students (and its endowment) by dramatically increasing the housing stock devoted to multi-year living options for all students and organizations. Let supply rise to meet the overwhelming demand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stanford has formed a new task force to see how to restore fun to the campus. One solution is to make everybody happy with their housing options, instead of making everyone equally unhappy as Ms. Young proposes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Alumni Reid

Philosophy and Literature and incoming ASSU Executive VP. This opinion does not reflect that of the ASSU or any other institution with which he is affiliated.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can only imagine the feeling of those who witnessed the blatant disregard for humanity when seeing the noose tied to the tree outside of Branner Hall on May 8, 2022. I am not surprised that someone would put their perceived superiority and elitism on display so brazenly. The dark history of lynching and the bigoted action of displaying a noose is synonymous with racial aggression toward those who are of African American descent &#x2014; but an often overlooked part of that history is the lynching that targeted Mexican natives and Mexican Americans for eight decades. As a person who values my identity and as an agent of change, I would like to educate those who are unaware of the history that surrounds those lynchings, which took place in the southwest and in Santa Clara County.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People of Mexican origin and Mexican Americans entered a racial crisis after the Mexican-American War. After the annexation and occupation of the southwest by the United States, mob violence was a reality that plagued Mexicanos, even despite the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.archives.gov\/education\/lessons\/guadalupe-hidalgo#background\">Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo<\/a>, which allowed Mexicans already living in the US-occupied southwest to remain landowners and gain civil rights. It is important that this history be acknowledged, especially in a time where discussions of racial injustice in the United States often center on Black and white identities. Mexican Americans were also hanged by white supremacist vigilante groups, primarily as retribution in absence of a formal justice system; these acts were never called into question because white culture did not care that Mexicans were hanged. White vigilante and outlaw justice were commonplace in the Wild West, and the justice system was still in its infancy, leading to the heinous and inhumane lynchings of Mexicans based on race and unfounded accusations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mexican Americans were victims of almost <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/3790404?seq=5\">600 lynchings between 1848 and 1928<\/a>. These lynchings began in the California Gold Rush &#x2014; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/3790404?seq=12\">about 170 lynchings happened from 1848 to 1860<\/a> &#x2014; and ended a decade after the Mexican Revolution. By moving Mexicans out of gold mines in San Francisco, white vigilantes would scare off thousands of Mexican miners from their organized gold-hunting groups to steal their gold and resources. Eventually, this tactic led to unjust lynchings of Mexican and Mexican American people based on race and economic competition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Texas, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/3790404?seq=13\">where over 280 lynchings took place from 1848 to 1928<\/a>, lynchings were justified by the sentiment that &#x201C;Texas Country&#x201D; was no place for Mexicans and that it was not a crime, morally, to kill a Mexican. As a result of being cut off from economic growth opportunities in the southwest, Mexicans began turning into bandits or &#x201C;banditos,&#x201D; most of whom were political revolutionaries acting against their economic exclusion. White Americans interpreted these &#x201C;banditos&#x201D; as lawless nuisances and killed them in response. In retaliation to the discrimination and violent attacks, Mexican natives and Mexican Americans drafted a call to action called the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/3790404?seq=15\">&#x201C;Plan of San Diego,&#x201D;<\/a> which <a href=\"https:\/\/digitalcommons.unl.edu\/unpresssamples\/205\/\">called<\/a> for native Mexicans and Mexican Americans to kill all white males ages 16 and older. As a result of this plan, white Americans killed an undocumented number of Mexican natives and Mexican Americans.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, over the final two decades of this violent outbreak, several civil rights groups fought for the abolition of mob violence targeting Mexicans and Mexican Americans. Although there were many breakthroughs for their African American compatriots, the larger American population was still not sold on the citizenship of Mexicans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite increased awareness of the issue of lynching during the civil rights movement, there was still little awareness of <a href=\"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/0739986319899737\">the lynchings of Mexican natives and Mexican Americans<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hanging of Tiburcio V&#xE1;squez is tied closely to the history of Santa Clara. In white America, he was considered a bandito during the height of Mexican resistance to white American lynchings of Mexicans and Mexican Americans. <a href=\"https:\/\/scvhistory.com\/scvhistory\/laws01161875.htm\">V&#xE1;squez was tried and convicted of murder and theft<\/a>, and although he maintained his innocence, he was hanged outside of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scscourt.org\/general_info\/community\/och_history.shtml\">courthouse<\/a> on North First Street in San Jose on March 19, 1875. The courthouse still stands in the same location.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a Chicano at Stanford means a lot to me. I am the first in my family to go to a university, and I am the first in my family to pursue a graduate degree. I am trying to be the example I want my children to follow &#x2014; not of going to college, but of resilience and motivation to pursue one&#x2019;s dreams and passions.

href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/2022\/05\/04\/stanford-doerr-school-sustainability-universitys-first-new-school-70-years-will-accelerate-solutions-global-climate-crisis\/\">recently announced<\/a> that donors have contributed nearly $1.7 billion to establish the Doerr School of Sustainability, the University&#x2019;s first new school in 70 years. While these funds will support crucial research related to the climate crisis, the administration of the new school has made clear that it will <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/05\/04\/climate\/john-doerr-stanford-climate.html\">continue accepting financial contributions from the fossil fuel industry<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stanford&#x2019;s decision to maintain its ties to the fossil fuel industry is incompatible with the new school&#x2019;s focus on actionable solutions to address climate change. Let&#x2019;s be clear: fossil fuel companies&#x2019; contributions to universities such as Stanford are not only philanthropic. These donations are part of a carefully crafted smokescreen, one that disguises their role in a crisis they&#x2019;re perpetuating, one that helps them gain false legitimacy, and one that wins them influence on climate change-related research.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the last several months, we&#x2019;ve developed an open letter and accompanying petition for the Stanford community to sign, calling on the School of Sustainability to decline funding from fossil fuel companies. This is an ask with an immense amount of support from the community: in <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/1De229fAqqYl0Qd2EriOEBfk7t1g1TiOrh-3utxyNCJ4\/edit?usp=sharing\">a recent survey<\/a>, graduate students in the School of Earth ranked declining funding from problematic or polluting industries such as fossil fuel companies as the most important measure for the new school to implement. With so much at stake for current and future generations facing the impacts of climate change, it&#x2019;s crucial that leading institutions like Stanford use their influence and resources to signal the urgent need for climate action. For the Doerr School, this can start with changing attitudes towards funding from the fossil fuel industry.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to truly align with its mission, it is critical that the Doerr School of Sustainability be sustainable not only in name, but also in action. By sharing our open letter below, we hope to motivate others here at Stanford to take action and speak out in support of a better world. If you&#x2019;d like to share your support, you can sign the petition <a href=\"https:\/\/forms.gle\/iAPEDWR9VuDtTNEm7\">here<\/a>.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x2014; Graduate Student Advisory Committee, Department of Earth System Science<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>___<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Dr. Arun Majumdar, Dean of the Doerr School of Sustainability,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Congratulations on your recent appointment as Dean of the newly established Doerr School of Sustainability. We are grateful for your leadership, vision and career dedicated to a sustainable energy future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The formation of this new School marks a historic opportunity for Stanford University to take a bold effort toward mitigating climate change. Stanford&#x2019;s School of Earth, Energy and the Environment relies heavily on fossil fuel funding, and we believe such funding represents an inherent conflict of interest, is incompatible with the University&#x2019;s core academic and social values, and supports industry greenwashing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We, the undersigned faculty, students, postdocs, staff and alumni of Stanford University, therefore call for the Doerr School of Sustainability and affiliated institutions to decline funding from fossil fuel companies. <\/strong>Instead, the School should seek out partnerships with organizations and companies who are fully aligned with Stanford&#x2019;s vision of achieving carbon neutrality. We want to note that our call applies to the Doerr School of Sustainability and affiliated institutions, not to the funding obtained by individual faculty members.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Continuing to accept funding from and collaborating with the fossil fuel industry presents a conflict of interest for the School of Sustainability, as many fossil fuel companies have a proven record of actively obscuring the scientific consensus on climate change, obstructing climate policy and knowingly and willingly perpetuating the climate crisis. Contrary to messages promoted by the industry, the core business of fossil fuel companies remains the production and distribution of fossil fuels, and substantial diversification into clean and renewable energy <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/16091645-98b3-4041-9ca2-053fb60181ba\">has not occurred<\/a>. By collaborating with fossil fuel companies, the School <a href=\"https:\/\/fossilfreeresearch.com\/\">endangers its academic integrity<\/a>. It is difficult to imagine that fossil fuel companies &#x2014; whose core business model is diametrically opposed to science-led climate action &#x2014; are appropriate partners for climate-related research. It is no longer reasonable, let alone ethical, for the School to maintain its ties with the industry most responsible for perpetuating the climate crisis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strong collaboration between the School of Sustainability and the fossil fuel industry also threatens our school&#x2019;s credibility, reputation and attractiveness for current and prospective students, staff and faculty. Though these companies present themselves as leaders in sustainability, their investments in oil and gas continue to dwarf their renewable energy investments, which represent just a small percentage of their total capital expenditure. Collaborating with these companies is<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2022\/feb\/16\/oil-firms-climate-claims-are-greenwashing-study-concludes#:~:text=Accusations%20of%20greenwashing%20against%20major,most%20comprehensive%20study%20to%20date\"> inimical to academic institutions&#x2019; pledges for climate action<\/a>. Continued funding from fossil fuel companies threatens to erode trust in Stanford&#x2019;s scientific and cultural commitment to climate action. The research conducted at Stanford carries significant weight in the conversation around tackling the climate crisis, and the University cannot afford to lose out on the brightest talents or have its voice compromised.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We appreciate the impacts that a change in the attitude towards fossil fuel funding will have on the Doerr School of Sustainability and its affiliated institutions. However, we believe that Stanford&#x2019;s location, history and connections to the private sector will enable the School of Sustainability to forge new relations and partnerships that are aligned with its vision and values. Scientific research tells us that the window for action is closing, and we believe that as one of the world&#x2019;s leading academic institutions, we have a moral responsibility to act.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sincerely yours,&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The undersigned faculty, students, postdocs, staff and alumni of Stanford University<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See the list of signees <a

While on campus, she co-chaired the Asian American Students&#8217; Association (AASA), served as the Asian American intern at DOSA, and participated in the Asian American Theater Project&#8217;s 1979 production of &#8220;FOB.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I entered Stanford in 1978. At the time, about six to seven percent of the undergraduate students identified as Asian Americans. One of my reasons for choosing Stanford over other colleges was the presence of an Asian American theme dorm. Growing up in Los Angeles, I went to a high school that was racially diverse thanks to busing, though I didn&#x2019;t live in a predominantly Asian community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Except for learning about the mass incarceration of Japanese Americans by our own U.S. government during WWII, I didn&#x2019;t know much about Asian Americans. As I continued my academic journey by attending Stanford, I hoped to explore my identity as a third-generation Japanese American, and how it fit into my vague notion of building a better world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once I arrived on the Farm, though, I was disappointed to find there were no courses that examined the history of Asian immigrants in the U.S. Instead, I had to explore Asian American history outside the classroom, through Junipero (the Asian American theme dorm before it was renamed Okada House), the Asian American Student Association (AASA), and other Asian American student organization activities. I spent most of my extracurricular time at the Asian American Activities Center (A<sup>3<\/sup>C) organizing student events, or working on AA issues off-campus, both in the Asian American community and on other university campuses.&nbsp; We supported efforts to oppose the <a href=\"https:\/\/projects.sfchronicle.com\/2017\/international-hotel\">displacement of Chinatown residents<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/diva.sfsu.edu\/collections\/sfbatv\/bundles\/190408\">destructive commercial redevelopment of Japantown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During my time at Stanford, Black\/African American, Chicano\/Latinx, Native American, and Asian American students worked together to draw attention to disparities we experienced on campus and in our communities off-campus. Organizations of students of color were constantly urging Stanford to live up to its stated commitment to diversity by providing resources to support minority students, who were often marginalized. Although there was a Dean of Student Affairs for Black students, the other communities of color had no full-time staff &#x2014; only student interns &#x2014; to provide a voice for their community in the Office of Student Affairs. The University made no effort to develop any Asian American Studies courses. The one AA class available to me and other students was one that students themselves organized and taught through the Stanford Workshops on Political and Social Issues (SWOPSI). This continued to be the case for many years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After graduating, I worked with others in the Stanford Asian Pacific American Alumni Club (SAPAAC) to support the growing student demand for Asian American Studies, which resulted in <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2014\/05\/23\/csre-major-grows-out-of-1994-hunger-strike-into-fastest-growing-major\/\">the establishment<\/a> of the Comparative Studies in Race &amp; Ethnicity (CSRE) program. But since that high point, we have seen the AAS program at Stanford surpassed by AAS departments at other colleges and universities in California and across the country. This disparity is not from lack of faculty talent, but rather an apparent lack of conviction on the part of the administration. For over four decades, Stanford has never clearly signaled that ethnic studies is a vital academic pursuit worthy of institutional support. Consequently, our AAS program has been unable to attract and retain more than a handful of leading Asian Pacific American scholars.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is it important to offer a more robust program? I am a lawyer working in the field of poverty law. Understanding the history of discrimination and racist policies aimed at different racial and ethnic minority communities over decades is critical to determining how policies and laws need to change if we are to address the growing disparities between the rich and poor in our country. However, there is little research that disaggregates the diverse Asian\/Pacific Islander data being collected by state and federal agencies, which might help government and nonprofits better target anti-poverty policy and services. We also continue to see the role race plays in keeping communities divided. Even Asian\/Pacific Islander professionals, who have economic advantages, have come to realize that racism and discrimination affect their lives, whether it is the &#x201C;bamboo ceiling&#x201D; that they experience when trying to get promoted, or the anti-Asian violence that has escalated since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the recent Black Lives Matter reckoning, we are, perhaps, finally recognizing that racism remains a deep-seated problem that continues to feed inequality and division. Understanding this history and connecting it to contemporary concerns is the pathway to change.&nbsp; As Provost Persis Drell <a href=\"https:\/\/provost.stanford.edu\/statement-on-diversity-and-inclusion\/\">recently acknowledged<\/a>, Stanford has a role to play in increasing research and teaching about race on the path to overcoming racism and inequality in our world. This includes addressing the racism and inequality affecting Asian Americans and other communities of color in the United States.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the University actually believes that addressing race and inequality is a priority, it&#x2019;s time to back up good intentions with real action. Stanford must seize this opportunity to make meaningful progress by allocating enough University resources to provide Asian American Studies and other ethnic&nbsp;studies programs at Stanford with sufficient numbers of tenured faculty to build leading centers of research and study. Alumni are willing to support this effort, but the University itself must step up now. We&#x2019;ve been waiting long enough.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hope Nakamura argues that Stanford must better support the university&#8217;s Asian American Studies program. &#8220;I am a lawyer working in the field of poverty law.

Emmett Interdisciplinary Program for Environment &amp; Resources (E-IPER), where she works to bridge climate science and policy. She is also a senior fellow at Data for Progress.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Yannai Kashtan is currently a doctoral student in the Earth Systems Science program. He is from Oakland, California.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today marks one week since news of the John Doerr School of Sustainability broke &#x2014; a new school at Stanford dedicated expressly to sustainability. This was a much-anticipated announcement: for more than a year, students and faculty have eagerly worked alongside administration to envision what a school premised on climate and environmental solution-building might look like. Doerr is Stanford&#x2019;s first new school in 70 years, and comes as other <a href=\"https:\/\/news.columbia.edu\/news\/columbia-establish-climate-school\">peer<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/environment.yale.edu\/news\/article\/school-of-forestry-and-environmental-studies-to-become-yale-school-of-the-environment#:~:text=Effective%20July%201%2C%202020%2C%20the,scholarship%2C%20practice%2C%20and%20solutions.\">institutions<\/a> have rolled out their own climate schools. Perhaps most impressively, its founding gift of <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/2022\/05\/04\/stanford-doerr-school-sustainability-universitys-first-new-school-70-years-will-accelerate-solutions-global-climate-crisis\/\">$1.69 billion<\/a> is the largest in Stanford&#x2019;s history, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chronicle.com\/article\/major-private-gifts-to-higher-education\/\">second largest<\/a> for any institution of higher education in the U.S. In no uncertain terms, this is a critical and long-overdue step in Stanford&#x2019;s response to climate change.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The school is not, however, the golden ticket to climate salvation as many of its proponents would lead us to believe. Its lofty goals, published in a <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1JO92PW9_unnbZh_BrwCCDIlm4WrHvFEyjqqHfj7Bb-Q\/edit?usp=sharing\">draft<\/a> today, center on instilling students with three core competencies: systems thinking, transdisciplinarity and values thinking. Worthy goals indeed. The process of developing the new school has itself shirked these principles, however. In his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/05\/04\/climate\/john-doerr-stanford-climate.html\">interview<\/a> with The New York Times, inaugural dean Arun Majumdar is cited saying the new school would work with and accept donations from fossil fuel companies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accepting money from fossil fuel interests, even those claiming to diversify their portfolios, fundamentally undermines the school&#x2019;s core learning competencies, tarnishes its academic reputation and hampers its <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/2022\/05\/04\/stanford-doerr-school-sustainability-universitys-first-new-school-70-years-will-accelerate-solutions-global-climate-crisis\/\">stated mission<\/a> of &#x201C;solving the most complex problems in climate and sustainability.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite active student opposition to fossil fuel entanglements, the school&#x2019;s acquiescence is in many ways unsurprising. Funding academic research is a tried and true industry strategy employed to control and stymie scholarship. Their hope &#x2014; a well-founded one &#x2014; is that controlling the ivory tower will in turn allow them to control regulation and political change that threatens their business model. As Bruce Owen and Ronald Braeutigam write in their 1978 book &#8220;The Regulation Game: Strategic Use of the Administrative Process&#8221;:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Regulatory policy is increasingly made with the participation of experts, especially academics. A regulated firm or industry should be prepared whenever possible to coopt these experts. This is most effectively done by identifying the leading experts in each relevant field and &#x2026; giving them research grants and the like &#x2026; [I]t must not be too blatant, for the experts themselves must not recognize that they have lost their objectivity and freedom of action.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By donating to climate and sustainability research, industry can <a href=\"https:\/\/gcep.stanford.edu\/about\/projectselectionprocess.html\">control which research gets funded<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/seca.stanford.edu\/membership-overview\">obtain early access to research directions and results<\/a>, which gives them time to get ahead of negative press. It also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2021\/apr\/19\/a-great-deception-oil-giants-taken-to-task-over-greenwash-ads\">casts them as the good guys<\/a> in the academic and public eye &#x2014; all the while <a href=\"https:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0263596#sec024\">chronically underperforming<\/a> on even the sustainability goals they set for themselves.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, the state of fossil fuel money entanglement with climate research parallels tobacco money entanglement with public health research, except that public health researchers are further along in disentangling their research from industry funds. Four years ago, the deans of 19 public health schools <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bmj.com\/content\/360\/bmj.k555\">collectively signed a statement<\/a> refusing tobacco funding, stating &#x201C;both the tobacco industry and Philip Morris International have a long history of funding &#x2018;research&#x2019; in ways meant to purposely confuse the public and advance their own interests, aggressively market cigarettes globally, including to children, and persist in their relentless opposition to evidence based tobacco control interventions.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a similar act of integrity, last month hundreds of climate and sustainability faculty <a href=\"https:\/\/fossilfreeresearch.com\/#who\">signed a pledge<\/a> committing to refuse fossil fuel money because they &#x201C;believe this funding represents an inherent conflict of interest, is antithetical to universities&#x2019; core academic and social values, and supports industry greenwashing. Thus, it compromises universities&#x2019; basic institutional integrity, academic freedom, and their ability to address the climate emergency.&#x201D; There is an increasing awareness of the harms of fossil fuel entanglement with climate research and growing numbers of individual faculty are refusing to accept fossil fuel money.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fossil fuel companies have made splashy headlines recently announcing net-zero goals and sustainability targets. If they are willing to change, shouldn&#x2019;t we collaborate with them, as Dean Majumdar suggests? The Danish company &#xD8;rsted is often brought up as an industry poster-child and an implicit argument in favor of industry collaboration. &#xD8;rsted began as an oil and gas company, but by 2017 had entirely divested itself of fossil assets and is currently the world&#x2019;s largest developer of offshore wind power. Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Total, Eni and the other large oil companies from which Stanford has accepted millions are nothing like &#xD8;rsted. While <a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/Climate-solutions\/Advancing-climate-solutions#Advancingclimatesolutions\">claiming<\/a> to &#x201C;advance innovative solutions for a lower-emission energy future,&#x201D; they continue to plow the vast majority of their capital into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2021\/apr\/19\/a-great-deception-oil-giants-taken-to-task-over-greenwash-ads\">fossil fuel projects<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/productiongap.org\/2021report\/\">at odds with the Paris Agreement.<\/a> Until these companies actually transform themselves into renewable energy companies, their sustainability claims<a href=\"https:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0263596#sec024\"> are not to be trusted<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Claiming that accepting fossil fuel money is benign fails to recognize the system of industry influence in which the school is a part. Willingness to partner with companies that for decades have acted in bad faith and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/09644016.2021.1947636#.YSjeb31jIck.twitter\">used academic partnerships as key tools to greenwash<\/a> their climate-warming and polluting business practices fails to align high-level administrative decisions with the stated values of the school. The most powerful and influential members of the new school should lead by example; if they do not demonstrate systems and values thinking, how are we to expect this of students?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to contradicting Doerr&#x2019;s stated competencies, fossil fuel partnership flies in the face of meaningful student input. Over the past year, the transition team has gestured toward (and in some cases promised outright) students having a seat at the table. While at the table, we&#x2019;ve been clear: the school cannot accept fossil fuel money and still claim to advance climate action. We&#x2019;ve attended fora, provided written feedback, taken polls. Each time, refusing funding from polluting industries has been one of the most <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1WK9O0IVoIMgYxN9WzvodAdCUYwgmM-hFNPamfdlxMtw\/edit?usp=sharing\">popular policy proposals<\/a> &#x2014; one that enables the other changes we desperately need in a new school, including a strong emphasis on environmental and climate justice.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the news of the Doerr School of Sustainability is certainly exciting, the value of an institution&#x2019;s work cannot be extricated from the values upon which it is built. Pledging to accept fossil fuel funding and partner with the very industry that has stalwartly opposed climate action for decades is not only wholly misaligned with the will of students &#x2014; it promises to feed the same maelstrom of political inaction, mistrust of science and perpetuation of environmental injustice that it claims to counter. A growing coalition of students, faculty, staff and alumni have seen the writing on the wall; we are committed to working with the incoming administration to shape the Doerr School into the &#x201C;<a

progress on the &#x2026; clean energy future<\/a>.&#x201D; The question remains if the Stanford administration &#x2014; and, yes, the Doerrs themselves &#x2014; share our

He also works in the Inclusion, Diversity &amp; Purpose department for Discord. He is from Fontana, California.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is my first year on the Stanford campus. As we draw near the end of spring, I am left with a resounding wondering, which I think is shared by my peers &#x2014; <em>is it always like this?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This question brings me deep shame, as I am met with an obvious answer from within myself &#x2014; <em>of course, and you knew better. It must be.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With yet another egregious incident of anti-Black racism and violence &#x2014; the second time that a noose has been found on University grounds during this academic year &#x2014; our student population is not left with many other conclusions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I am learning, Stanford is a rather small school. It presents as very large but our community is small and insular. So acts such as these are especially incendiary. We walk past these people every day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Something about racism that I think gets lost in the perpetual shuffle of diversionary tactics &#x2014; denials, institutional bureaucracy, statements, panel discussions, academic research, a lack of statements and other forms of misdirection &#x2014; is that racism brings you closer to death.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is about killing people. It is that simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sunday&#x2019;s affairs have shortened the life span of students on campus. They take hold of space in the brain, and they manifest as a tightness in the body. They tire and weigh down on. They impact the quality of education that we can receive. They contribute to attrition on campus. Friendships wilt. Glances are exchanged, and sighs are shared. And for some, irreversible damage has been caused.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some will never feel safe again in our community. To some others, this may not feel like a major concern, but it should be. Because we can never get those people and their trust back &#x2014; nor do we deserve that until we receive true answers and solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We cannot be surprised that these actions keep happening in this space we share.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you invite prominent guest speakers with long histories of racism and discrimination, when you allow student organizations which antagonize historically marginalized groups to operate on campus, when your student body has been, and continues to be, homogenous at the intersections of privilege &#x2014; these are the kind of responses that become emboldened on campus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the culture we sit on at Stanford.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the Petri dish that breeds organisms of hate, bigotry and ignorance. It is actually the perfect setting. We cannot be absolved by blaming this all on a few bad actors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Walking through Stanford can be very difficult for anyone not occupying a position of power &#x2014; I know it has been for me. I have been asked to verify that I am a student on campus multiple times &#x2014; even by my classmates. When incidents like this occur, you begin to question if you are making up an alternate reality, externally, to validate your feelings, internally. You begin to make excuses for the behavior you are experiencing: <em>Am I exaggerating? Did that really happen? Maybe I am taking this way too personally.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the great trick that whiteness plays on everyone, including white people &#x2014; that whiteness is a construction made by each of us, not a construction of the larger system and the history that we share. It prevents you from listening to your intuition. It makes you question what you know and feel. And if whiteness can convince you that you are the one making up these problems, then that means you are alone in solving them. It creates a sense of isolation, and you cannot trust the feelings that you have, nor their sources. And if you determine that you cannot trust yourself, then you surely cannot trust anyone else, which in turn leads to the antagonization and hatred of people who are different from you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the state of vulnerability and fear that white supremacy feeds on. It makes us quiet when we should be loud. But knowing about this tactic does not make it any easier. Writing this article has not made me feel any better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to be very clear: these recent attacks affect our Black community members first and foremost, and it is their well-being and voices that we should be centering.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But to all the non-Black people in our community, this directly impacts you as well. When one person&#x2019;s safety is threatened, your safety and my safety are threatened, too. We do not treat these threats of hate accordingly because we have a history of re-founding and othering in this country, and <em>that<\/em> history has been rewarded.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also do not treat these threats accordingly because there are rarely concrete outcomes of accountability when actions like this occur.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But all our collective well-being will crumble eventually. There are no winners in displays of white supremacy. There are only those who are harmed and those who believe they will not be harmed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even those who enact violence, however, are deeply impacted by its effects. It is myopic and negligent toward the history of abuses of power to assume that anyone will be left unscathed. That is why we <em>all<\/em> should take these moments personally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the year continuing to unravel here on campus, I return to our principal question &#x2014; <em>is it always going to be like this?<\/em> This is not rhetorical.

From 1999-2008, he attended Ravenswood schools Edison Brentwood Elementary and Ronald McNair Middle School. He is currently finishing his second year of his Ph.D. in Modern Thought &amp; Literature at Stanford.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/em><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still remember the smell of powder &#x2014; not the kind that once flooded our streets, but the kind that filled our classrooms. The chalked hands of my school&#x2019;s sole music teacher hovered over us. We sat &#x201C;criss-cross applesauce&#x201D; on the carpet, its thin layer of shag not much of a cushion between our cabooses and the floor. Huddled together, all thirty-two of us, we were trying to decipher the sheet music our teacher had just given us. <em>A song? <\/em>Tania cried out, <em>What&#x2019;s that got to do with the STAR test? <\/em>Marcel seconds her dissent: <em>Ayo, ain&#x2019;t we supposed to be doing math problems or something?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Ms. Parker would have none of it. &#x201C;Back to the top guys, c&#x2019;mon, we only got 40 minutes here. And don&#x2019;t just say the words. Really <em>listen<\/em> to them. Understand the meaning.&#x201D; Like a broken faucet, the words spill out in stutters, lumps of syllables that betrayed our confusion. But eventually, after endless loops of the song on the old Panasonic stereo, our voices flowed into a single stream of I&#x2019;s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I Know I Can<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be What I Wanna Be<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I Work Hard on It<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#x2019;ll Be Where I Wanna Be<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>*<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I had to encapsulate my experience as a K-8 student in Ravenswood School District, it would be this moment with Ms. Parker in Edison Brentwood Academy: her insistence, and the insistence of countless educators who stayed despite the low pay, that Black and Brown children are only captives to our imaginations. No zip code, no conservatorship by the state or a county grand jury, no <em>one<\/em> would determine our outcome in life but us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I Know I Can&#x201D; by Nasir Jones. Throughout my whole career as a Ravenswood kid, I carried the Queensbridge poet&#x2019;s words with me. But as inspiring as Nas&#x2019;s words were and still are to me, my years in higher education and public service have made me realize that our public schools, like the cities in which they&#x2019;re housed, can only flourish as much as we invest in them. Displacement, a high cost of living and a hyper-saturation of schools in our small city have taken their toll on our district. And in 2020, citing budget cuts and precipitous declines in enrollment, the school board closed Brentwood as well as Belle Haven Elementary School.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the upcoming June ballot, residents of East Palo Alto and Belle Haven will consider a measure that would, if passed, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.paloaltoonline.com\/news\/2022\/05\/08\/ravenswoods-measure-i-asks-district-residents-to-approve-110m-school-bond\">provide 110 million dollars<\/a> in bonds to the Ravenswood School District. The district plans to dedicate the majority of those funds to modernize Costa&#xF1;o Elementary School and Cesar Chavez Ravenswood Middle School. Many of the aging portables have outlived their temporary use. Buildings have remained largely untouched since the 1950s. Beyond replacing these portables with permanent classrooms, Measure I seeks to upgrade the efficiency and technology of elementary schools in the area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some will argue that we shouldn&#x2019;t give more to a school district that has already received measures in the past. &#x201C;Antonio,&#x201D; they say, &#x201C;haven&#x2019;t we given enough?&#x201D; How may I adequately respond by summarizing the history of inequality in a single breath? How may I convince parents, who have perhaps attended Ravenswood themselves and had a less-than-memorable experience, that a single measure will not undo decades of redlining, blockbusting and white flight, on top of a weak tax base? We need decades&#x2019; worth of resources to repair decades of damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others will be blunter in their assessments. &#x201C;Why should I give to a district that&#x2019;s mismanaged funds in the past?&#x201D; The logic behind this statement seems almost biblical, arguing that children must inherit the mistakes of their predecessors. By that same logic, is our own city then ineligible for state and federal aid? Is the fact that our children were and will continue to be taught there not enough of a reason to support Ravenswood?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To the anti-reform skeptics, I wish to remind you that on the road to self-determination, even nations err. We are a young city that has had less than forty years to position itself on a par with centuries-old municipalities. As the great Bob Hoover <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/23458988\">said<\/a> in an interview for &#8220;Dreams of a City&#8221; (a documentary filmed in the late 1990s about East Palo Alto), &#x201C;Unfortunately, none of us are experts in the area of community development, of building a city, so we are kind of learning as we go along. This is on-the-job training.&#x201D;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What value is there in continuing to point fingers? Let&#x2019;s join hands. Yes, we must learn from the past, but why let it obscure the present? And that present is the fact that, over the years, Ravenswood leadership has taken countless steps to improve the quality of learning for its students. In 2008, the same year I graduated from Edison McNair Academy (now Los Robles), the district partnered up with concerned educational advocates and philanthropists to create Ravenswood Education Foundation (REF), whose private funds have increased instructional quality through coaching and collaboration time, enrichment in the arts, SEL support, and more. Just this past year alone, REF has raised <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ravenswoodef.org\/uploads\/8\/0\/9\/4\/80945890\/annual_2021_vf.pdf\">over 9 million dollars<\/a> for Ravenswood. Recently, REF has implemented a program that matches teacher pay viz. neighboring districts to ensure we hire the best and brightest educators. Just this past month, the Robotics team at Chavez went to the world robotics championship! And just the other day, as I distributed Measure I literature, I had a conversation with Liliana, a first grader at the Los Robles dual immersion program. She practically spoke better Spanish than I did. And in a city where two thirds of the population is Latino, in a state where Latinos are the largest ethnic minority, we must equip our children, regardless of their backgrounds, with the skills they need to tackle their tomorrow.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a school board with skin in the game. This is a district that believes a child should not have to travel outside their own community in order to receive a good education. As school leaders, parents and fellow elected officials, we are all on mission to make Ravenswood second to none.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not just the letter of a policymaker. This is a letter of appeal as an alumnus, as a born and raised East Palo Altan whose entire life was transformed due to education, including my time at Ravenswood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not a showcase of poverty, nor is it a feel-good story of an alumnus who &#x201C;succeeded.&#x201D; This is one of many stories throughout the country of school districts that, like the cities they are in, struggle to retain the communities they serve.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a song that our children have been singing, but our bickering voices have muted theirs. This is a call for self-accountability, for us to recognize that so long as we as a community divest from our institutions of learning &#x2014; our public schools &#x2014; they will continue to struggle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In spite of how the years have hardened me, I am still singing that song alongside our children. I hope that by voting Yes on Measure I, and through your donations and volunteering to canvas alongside us, you will too.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Antonio Lopez argues in favor of passing Measure I and expanding funding for the Ravenswood School District. &#8220;This is a song that our children have been singing, but our bickering voices have muted theirs.

the community | No one should have washed away the chalk"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p><em>Katie Eder is a sophomore majoring in American Studies and minoring in Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday at around 10:30 p.m. I was walking my dog, Llama, as I do every night. Having just spent the afternoon and evening inundated by the news alerts and social posts about the Supreme Court&#x2019;s leaked decision to overturn <em>Roe v. Wade<\/em>, I felt frustration, grief and, frankly, exhaustion over the state of this country.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we walked through Meyer Green and headed toward the bookstore, I noticed a few people hunched over writing something on the ground in chalk. Having just seen the fliers for Planned Parenthood&#x2019;s pro-choice poster-making event, I assumed it was people preparing for the next day. But as I got closer, it became clear that the chalkers were not writing pro-choice messages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Written all over the ground at the top of White Plaza, surrounding the &#x201C;We Stand With Survivors&#x201D; banner honoring National Sexual Assault Prevention Month, were messages like &#x201C;Abortion is murder,&#x201D; &#x201C;Overturn Roe v. Wade&#x201D; and &#x201C;Life begins at conception.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing the thick yellow and red lines of that chalk, I was struck by the reality that there are students at this school who are so excited by <em>Roe v. Wade<\/em> being overturned that they wanted to publicly proclaim it. I&#x2019;d later learn that these students were part of Stanford College Republicans (SCR) and Stanford for Pro-Life. Yet they were also my classmates and peers. And this was what they believed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I knew there was no way I could simply go to sleep. I rushed back to Stern, called anyone and everyone who&#8217;d show up, and stuffed boxes of chalk I had leftover from another event into my backpack. I gathered a few friends from the dorm and together we set out to White Plaza.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon arriving, it was clear I was not the only one who had seen the chalk and jumped into action. There was a group of about six other people who were in a clear confrontation with Stephen Sills, the president of SCR and lead chalker. The group who had just arrived was holding a giant trash bin filled with water and dumping it on the chalk messages. One of the people in the group, Eva Jones, was being questioned by Stephen as he held up his phone in front of their faces, flash on, recording.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I called out to Eva, and she came over. I let her know I had chalk, and we both agreed to stop with the water and instead cross out their messages and write our own. We felt it was important for people to see that there are students in our community who hold strong anti-choice views. But we also needed to show we weren&#x2019;t going to let those statements go unacknowledged. She let the rest of her friends know and we got to chalking.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the next almost two hours, past 1 a.m., about 30 people covered White Plaza with slogans such as &#x201C;My Body, My Choice,&#x201D; &#x201C;<em>Roe v. Wade<\/em> Saves Lives,&#x201D; &#x201C;Protect Women and Trans People&#x201D; and my personal favorite, &#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t like abortions, get a vasectomy.&#x201D; We blasted Eva&#x2019;s &#x201C;pu$$y punk&#x201D; playlist through a speaker and danced, hugged, cried and chalked together. After we plastered the Plaza and were down to nubs of chalk, we called it a night. I fell asleep a little past 2 a.m. with a lot of love for the community and connection that came out of this otherwise dark day.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next morning, I headed out to walk my dog and see all the beautiful chalk in the daylight. As I approached White Plaza, my heart sank. All the chalk was gone. Every last slogan and uterus drawing from the night before, gone. It had all been washed away.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I walked the perimeter in disbelief. Who washed the chalk? Was it SCR? The administration? And why?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As disturbed as I was, I couldn&#x2019;t let our voices be erased. I yet again beelined out of White Plaza and went to hunt down more chalk.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the midst of the chalk search, I eagerly texted people I thought might have Stephen&#x2019;s number. Finally, I managed to be put in a group chat with him. I explained that I wanted to write an op-ed about the events that had transpired the night before and asked if he would be willing to meet with me that afternoon to discuss. I wanted to know if he washed the chalk off.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I set a time with Stephen, acquired more chalk, and took off again for White Plaza. There was already a group of organizers from the Planned Parenthood club setting up the poster-making for their &#x201C;Bans Off Our Bodies&#x201D; event. I explained to them what had happened the night before and they enthusiastically supported re-chalking White Plaza.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I opened up the boxes and started at the second round. As more people joined and my hands once again were covered in orange dust, that feeling of love and community came back. There were hugs and &#x201C;d&#xE9;j&#xE0; vu&#x201D; jokes. And we did it a second time: we covered the ground with messages to stand up for what we know is true. &#x201C;Our Bodies, Our Choice,&#x201D; &#x201C;Working-class and low-income people will be disproportionately impacted by the abortion bans&#x201D; and &#x201C;Safe Abortions Save Lives.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few hours later, I met with Stephen. Sitting at the tables between the now chalk-covered plaza and Tresidder, we talked for 30 minutes. He told me about his life, his interests and his experience working with SCR. He explained that while he was glad we had written our viewpoints in chalk next to theirs, he had been frustrated that we had at first tried to wash away the chalk with water.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was fed up with feeling silenced by the rest of the student body and, without me even having to ask, disclosed that while he hadn&#x2019;t returned later that night, he didn&#x2019;t try to stop the members of the club who came back after we left, filled trash bins with water from the Claw fountain, and washed away the chalk.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully by the time you read this, you can still see the second round of chalking across White Plaza, and get a clear sense that I, and many other students, wholeheartedly, and adamantly believe that people should have full control of their bodies. But that&#x2019;s not the point of this piece.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point I want to make is this &#x2014; no one should have washed away any of the chalk.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I understand why, after seeing anti-choice chalk, the reaction a few people had was &#x201C;we have to wash this away. We can&#x2019;t let this be the message people see in the morning.&#x201D; That was not dissimilar to my reaction. I just happened to have chalk on hand to write our own messages rather than erasing the statements that were disagreeing. As soon as the group of people who had come with the water saw that we had chalk, they realized the best way to drown out anti-choice messages was not with water, but with messages of our own.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are living in a time where polarization in this country and hatred for those with opposing political views is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/politics\/2014\/06\/12\/political-polarization-in-the-american-public\/\">more extreme than it&#x2019;s been in decades<\/a>. We also are living at Stanford University, a college which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thefire.org\/the-state-of-free-speech-on-campus-stanford-university\/\">dramatically limits<\/a> students&#8217; ability to express political views publicly. White Plaza, designated the &#x201C;free speech&#x201D; zone, is <a href=\"https:\/\/osep.stanford.edu\/policies\/banners-fliers-chalking-and-posters\">the only place<\/a> on campus we&#x2019;re even allowed to do things like chalking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We, as students and future leaders, have a responsibility to do better than the adults around us. We cannot and should not silence each other. We should disagree. We should argue. We should scream our opinions from the rooftops to make sure they&#x2019;re heard. But silencing others as a way to have your voice dominate is not transformative. It&#x2019;s not radical. It&#x2019;s cancel culture that&#x2019;s preventing us from having honest discourse.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This rule, like most, is never hard and fast. There are times when speech instigates violence or expresses hate. However, when the news spotlights a critical issue and our elected officials and political leaders are taking actions that we disagree with or we support, we have to be able to talk about the issues. That&#x2019;s not always easy but it is necessary.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>College is the time to be challenged. Most of us will never be in as safe of a place to debate with each other as we are now. We must take advantage of that.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now&#x2019;s the time. Figure out what you care about. Learn how to construct an argument. Develop your voice. And use it.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The spelling of Stephen Sills name has been corrected.

Palo Alto is flanked by the San Andreas fault to the west and the Hayward fault to the east. In 1906, and then again in 1989, the ground under Stanford&#x2019;s campus was rearranged. Two people died. Main Quad buildings shifted on their foundations. Entire library collections were ruined. Statues fell headfirst through the pavement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But afterward &#x2014; once the shaking stopped &#x2014; Stanford evolved. The proximity of the disasters made it impossible not to. The 1906 quake spurred immense research efforts in engineering and geology, setting up the University to be a global leader in both fields today. Students mobilized to provide disaster relief in the destroyed cities of San Francisco and San Jose. After 1989, iconic campus landmarks &#x2014; the Bing Wing, Memorial Church, the Cantor Arts Center &#x2014; were rebuilt with the integrity necessary to withstand the next crisis. In 2001, the artist Andy Goldsworthy reconfigured 128 tons of sandstone &#x2014; debris from the destruction 10 years earlier &#x2014; into a river-like sculpture, buried in the earth behind Palm Drive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a lot of debris in our world right now. The past year has been marked by tragedies of all scales, from the global &#x2014; with the pandemic&#x2019;s continued toll and the heart-wrenching destruction of war in Ukraine &#x2014; to the specific, with the recent loss of members of our community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stories in the issue ask the question: how will we evolve this time?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grind editor Matthew Turk &#x2019;24 breaks down the science behind the Marriage Pact, and examines how a generation has come to embrace finding connection via algorithms. Equity Project Director Sarina Deb &#x2019;23 gets candid with Stanford students about how the pandemic alleviated or exacerbated their ongoing mental health battles. Staff writer Seamus Allen &#x2019;25 follows a Stanford student from her sorority house to the front lines of the Russian invasion. News desk editor Carolyn Stein &#x2019;23 examines the past and future of humanities education at Stanford, particularly how Stanford&#x2019;s Structured Liberal Education program emerged during the Vietnam War era from a campus charged with political debate and dissent. Finally, opinions desk editor Joyce Chen &#x2019;25 traces how Stanford&#x2019;s undergraduate studies came to be dominated by computer science, and questions the implications of an academic culture that favors prestige over passion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for reading &#x2013;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grace Carroll &#x2019;23<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dear reader, Our campus was built by earthquakes.
