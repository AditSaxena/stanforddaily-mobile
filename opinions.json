The decisions we make today about hiring and research funding in the Doerr School will shape the knowledge, skills and values that Stanford graduates bring to sustainability problem-solving for decades to come.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we have <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/05\/12\/from-the-community-stanford-has-a-chance-at-a-real-school-of-sustainability-if-it-refuses-fossil-fuel-meddling\/\">made <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/02\/from-the-community-should-any-fossil-fuel-company-qualify-for-funding-stanfords-school-of-sustainability-a-response-to-dean-majumdars-letter\/\">clear<\/a>, we welcome the opportunity to join this conversation to critically evaluate the mission-alignment of the programs that will be part of the new school. Incoming Dean Arun Majumdar has made <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.stanford.edu\/news\/message-arun-majumdar-looking-forward\">multiple promises<\/a> of a listening tour to engage with students, faculty and staff about the principles the Doerr School will uphold. Thus far, Dean Majumdar&#x2019;s office has scheduled private meetings with faculty, students and postdocs in each department separately but has not scheduled public forums. We contend that, without including public forums, this approach artificially silos conversations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure that the process for establishing shared values and criteria is as transparent, inclusive, and effective as possible, we demand the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Participatory town halls at least once a month, beginning at the start of the fall quarter. These town halls must encourage interaction and active dialogue, be open to the whole Stanford Doerr School community (across departments, faculty, staff and students) and must either:<ul><li>be in-person with online options for those who can only join remotely OR<\/li><li>if conducted virtually, allow for real-time questions and comments by attendees (no webinars)<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>A full schedule with town hall dates and office hours communicated to the Stanford community at least two weeks in advance<\/li><li>No new funding from fossil fuel companies while the listening tour is ongoing<\/li><li>A commitment to discussing and establishing clear, objective and impactful criteria for industry partnerships and enforcing the criteria once they are published<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dean Majumdar has not responded to our request for details on the administration&#x2019;s plans for the listening tour, nor have we heard whether or not Town Halls will be scheduled. In the meantime:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The Doerr School <a href=\"https:\/\/energy.stanford.edu\/news\/stanford-s-strategic-energy-alliance-funds-six-new-energy-research-projects-total-5-million\">has already accepted over $5 million<\/a> in new funding from Shell, Total, ExxonMobile, and Bank of America via the Strategic Energy Alliance.<\/li><li>More than <a href=\"https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/FossilFreeSustainabilitySchool\">700 students, faculty and staff <\/a>(and counting) agree that entangling the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability with fossil fuel companies would mark a conflict of interest and would thereby undermine the school&#x2019;s mission. This sentiment is shared by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dataforprogress.org\/blog\/2022\/7\/14\/voters-agree-fossil-fuel-funding-in-climate-research-presents-conflict-of-interest\">general public<\/a>. We have shown that many of <a href=\"https:\/\/truesustainabilityschool.com\/paris\">our partners<\/a> currently <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/02\/from-the-community-should-any-fossil-fuel-company-qualify-for-funding-stanfords-school-of-sustainability-a-response-to-dean-majumdars-letter\/\">fail to pass<\/a> the <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.stanford.edu\/news\/message-arun-majumdar-looking-forward\">four criteria<\/a> laid out by the Dean to determine the integrity of fossil fuel companies. Funding criteria and their enforcement should also reflect the demands of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gofossilfreestanford.org\/the-project\">Fossil Free Stanford,<\/a> and Stanford Alumni for Climate Action.&#xA0;<\/li><li>Despite <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.stanford.edu\/news\/faculty-cluster-hires-launched-climate-science-sustainable-development-environmental-justice\">signaling it would<\/a>, the Doerr school <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/22\/school-of-sustainabilitys-leadership-must-reinvest-in-environmental-justice-and-a-fossil-free-future\/\">has yet to launch<\/a> a true environmental justice (EJ) faculty cluster hire. Such a process <a href=\"https:\/\/www.science.org\/content\/article\/nih-s-new-cluster-hiring-program-aims-help-schools-attract-diverse-faculty\">would involve<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insightintodiversity.com\/cluster-hiring-grows-in-popularity-as-institutions-act-to-increase-faculty-diversity-and-advance-social-justice\/\">recruiting a group of scholars<\/a> to establish (interdisciplinary) EJ research at Stanford: a <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.stanford.edu\/departments\/departments\/institutes-and-initiatives\">stated<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.stanford.edu\/news\/qa-education-programs-within-new-school\">goal<\/a> of the Doerr school.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We therefore call on the Dean to initiate a transparent process for consulting with environmental justice experts and supporters on the school&#x2019;s hiring, funding, partnerships, and other critical decisions.<strong> <\/strong>The process should reflect the findings of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ejstanford.com\/new-school-focused-on-sustainability.html\">Environmental Justice Working Group<\/a>&#xA0;and its intergenerational leadership team of students, faculty and staff<strong>.<\/strong> Illustrating the broad and longstanding support for hiring EJ scholars at Stanford, the EJWG received over <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2021\/01\/27\/environmental-justice-must-be-foundational-to-the-new-school-of-sustainability\/\">800 signatures in support of its 2018 EJ cluster hire proposal<\/a> &#x2013; a priority that should be reflected in new school hiring decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A siloed and closed-door decision-making process is vulnerable to <a href=\"https:\/\/truesustainabilityschool.com\/big-oil-entanglements\">special interest groups<\/a> and short-sighted decisions that will forego deeper inquiry and deliberation on how we might build a new school that benefits the broader global community and generations to come. Given the long-term impact of these decisions, we urge Dean Majumdar and the Doerr School leadership to shape the school in a truly transparent and democratic manner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an opportunity for the Doerr School to demonstrate true leadership in this time of climate crisis. We look forward to joining the conversation in coming weeks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Undersigned,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/truesustainabilityschool.com\/\">Coalition for a True School of Sustainability<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Co-signed by:<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Yannai Kashtan: Yannai Kashtan is a Knight-Hennessy Scholar and a Ph.D. student in the Earth System Science program, where he researches the health effects of burning fossil fuels in the home.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Thom Hersbach: Thom Hersbach is a postdoctoral scholar at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, where he studies electrochemical hydrogen production and biomass conversion; the statements in this article are his personal opinions and do not reflect the official views of the US Department of Energy or Stanford University.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>June Choi: June Choi is a Ph.D. student in Earth System Science, researching the distributional welfare impacts of climate change.&#xA0;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daly Wettermark: Daly Wettermark is a masters student in Environmental Engineering, working in the field of wastewater treatment and reuse.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Celina Scott-Buechler: Celina Scott-Buechler is a Ph.D. student in the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program for Environment &amp; Resources (E-IPER) where she works to bridge climate science and policy.

Decades. All that wealth &#x2014; and for what? Truly a waste. You have no excuse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the way, when I address &#x201C;Stanford&#x201D; here, I am addressing those in positions of power and authority. The more power you have, and the more you are being paid, the more accountable you are to your community and for Stanford&#x2019;s failures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: In 2000, you let your &#x201C;star&#x201D; faculty violate my 22-year-old self. That&#x2019;s how my career began &#x2014; with violence I am still struggling to comprehend. I was so naive and inexperienced I was confused by what was happening.

How dare you! How dare you invade my home?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: This letter is repetitive because traumatic re-living is repetitive and you continue to resurrect those hideous memories by making headlines about rape culture on your campus.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: My parents sacrificed a lot to give me a life less chaotic and violent than theirs. They trusted you to keep their daughter safe from the &#x201C;bad&#x201D; behavior of serial abusers. Their trust was betrayed  &#x2014; not once, not twice, but over and over and over and over and over again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: CUNY is underfunded. You are overfunded. What is the correct way to redress such inequality? I don&#x2019;t know. I do know that letting your rape culture make contact with CUNY students is the wrong way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: Colleagues were &#8220;repeatedly asked to &#x2018;babysit&#x2019; Barletta&#8221;? In what universe is such infantilization of a serial abuser acceptable?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: You cannot possibly claim that you are &#x201C;helpless&#x201D; here, that you &#x201C;had no idea,&#x201D; that you are understaffed or under-resourced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: When I was a 22-year-old first-year Ph.D. student in your English Department, your &#x201C;star&#x201D; faculty raped and harassed me. I was unable, under such circumstances, to excel, to collaborate with colleagues (he isolated me), unable at times to work (I was too busy trying to avoid being raped), often unable to think at all. And my abuser did this to others at Stanford too. Not only did my abuser harm multiple students, but you continue to allow <a href=\"https:\/\/academic-sexual-misconduct-database.org\/incidents?query=stanford\">multiple people in positions of power and authority to harm generations of students and employees<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: How could you. How could you <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/news\/2008\/march12\/oldbooks-031208.html\">name that library in his honor<\/a> after you yourself punished him for what he did to me? He used one of those <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/SAAASA\/permalink\/5687106724695954\">books<\/a> to &#x2014; I won&#x2019;t finish this sentence. I won&#x2019;t go there. Not again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: You have squandered my patience and goodwill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/pr\/92\/920602Arc2192.html\">Archuleta<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/19\/a-stanford-professor-sexually-harassed-his-student-a-decade-ago-some-female-students-say-his-inappropriate-behavior-never-stopped\/\">Barletta<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/stanfordpolitics.org\/2017\/12\/03\/jay-fliegelman-sexual-misconduct\/\">Fliegelman<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2017\/11\/16\/harassment-assault-allegations-against-moretti-span-three-campuses\/\">Moretti<\/a> &#x2014; why? Just &#x2014; why?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: This is not how I want to be spending my summer. I was actually working on my book project when news about Vincent Barletta &#x201C;mentoring&#x201D; CUNY students reset my brain&#x2019;s time zone to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/PTSD?src=hashtag_click\">#PTSD<\/a>. For the past month, I&#x2019;ve been re-living the year 2000 (when your &#x201C;star&#x201D; faculty violated my 22-year-old self).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: Fuck you for <a href=\"https:\/\/stanfordmag.org\/contents\/remembering-jay-fliegelman\">covering up<\/a> the abuse and the punishment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: You are Victor Frankenstein and my suffering is the creature you made. Take responsibility for your creation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: I had just turned 22 years old.&nbsp; I was naive and inexperienced. I was a first-year graduate student, new to the profession, new to teaching, new to California, new to Stanford. He was tenured. He was powerful. He was in his 50s. <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/pr\/2007\/pr-fliegelman-082207.html\">He had been a Stanford institution for decades<\/a>. This is disjointed because I&#8217;m reliving it all over again. Shortly after he violated me, I was hospitalized. Shortly after I was discharged from the hospital, I gave a <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn.kqed.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/10\/2017\/12\/Syllabus.jpg\">guest lecture on Seneca Falls and women&#x2019;s rights<\/a>. His response was to tell me I forgot to mention women&#8217;s right to sexual pleasure. There are gaps here because trauma is nonlinear, trauma broke my sense of time. At some point you conducted an investigation. As a <a href=\"https:\/\/academic-sexual-misconduct-database.org\/person\/jay-fliegelman\">result<\/a> of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.documentcloud.org\/documents\/4323656-Debra-Zumwalt-Letter-to-Seo-Young-Chu-11-27-2017.html\">the investigation<\/a>, which was a brutal experience, you punished my abuser by suspending him for two years without pay. Some of his colleagues had the gall to blame me for the whole debacle.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: By enabling rape culture and abuse to flourish, you promote hostile thinking environments. You poison ideas. You destroy minds. You weaken intellectual communities. You prevent work from happening.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: Every minute, hour, day, week, month, year, decade of your silence and inaction is disrupting my &#x201C;career,&#x201D; is relevant to my work, has shaped my sense of self as an academic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: I&#x2019;ve never sued you. I&#x2019;ve generously given you free feedback. I&#x2019;ve extended every deadline. I&#x2019;ve been more than patient with you. I&#x2019;ve spent countless hours <a href=\"https:\/\/asapjournal.com\/after-a-refuge-for-jae-in-doe-a-social-media-chronology\/\">educating you<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/asecsgradcaucus.wordpress.com\/2017\/11\/11\/asecs-executive-board-statement-on-harassment-and-abuse\/\">cleaning up your messes<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: By criticizing you I am not &#x201C;attacking&#x201D; your students, alumni, and workers. I am trying to make your campus better. Safer. More hospitable to learning. By speaking out like this I am trying to be a good alumna. I hope you are paying attention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: The truth is that my career started with rape. My career has been shaped by rape. My sense of who I am as an academic: shaped by rape. The gaps in my CV are trauma-generated plot holes that lead to Northern California in the year 2000.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: I&#x2019;m angry, I&#x2019;m disabled, I have work to do, I have a migraine. I want to lie down and shut my eyes and rest. But this is too important. I can&#x2019;t rest until CUNY is safe from your rape culture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: Have you even read &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/entropymag.org\/a-refuge-for-jae-in-doe-fugues-in-the-key-of-english-major\/\">A Refuge for Jae-in Doe<\/a>&#x201D;? The whole point of my sharing all that pain &#x2014; and in a language your English Department would understand: sonnets! The Western Canon! English (Major)! &#x2014; was to prevent more students from being harmed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: I am as &#x201C;proud&#x201D; to have a degree from your school as I would be &#x201C;proud&#x201D; to sport a blood diamond. Yes, the degree may glitter. But how much pain, injustice, conflict, humiliation, abuse, and violence does such glitter belie?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: I am ashamed to be associated with you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: If I were to write a book about your response to my requests for answers and answerability, most of the book&#x2019;s pages would be blank. Vacuous. Empty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: Emptiness, too, is a response. And by definition it is worthless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: Speaking out does not come naturally to me.

feedback is necessary for graduate admissions"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>7:25 p.m. &#x2014; I nervously checked the time on my computer, while wiping away the beads of sweat that had started to form on my forehead. I had been praying, nay, pleading, for the last 10 minutes &#x2014; &#x201C;Please let this interview go well.&#x201D; I was on my last set of graduate school interviews. This was my last chance, I had been rejected everywhere else. I had no idea what I was doing wrong &#x2014; the platitudes of &#x201C;just be yourself&#x201D; from my classmates rang hollow within me.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just internalized it &#x2014; if &#x201C;just be yourself&#x201D; was not working, then something was definitely wrong with me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7:29 p.m. &#x2014; One minute to go. I took a final swig of water and thought to myself, &#x201D;If I ever find myself on the other side of the table, won&#x2019;t I change a few things&#x2026;&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been two years since that fateful interview day. Although I am currently a graduate student here at Stanford, I still have no idea what happened and why I was admitted. But in those two years, the pressing need to figure out what went wrong with the other interviews never left me. &#x201C;Why do you care, you are already at Stanford?&#x201D; was the common reaction I got from my acquaintances whenever I brought it up.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I do care &#x2014; I care deeply. Not because of my ego, but because of the reason why I am in graduate school. I am training to become a better engineer and scientist. And the only way to become a better engineer and scientist is through feedback.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As scientists, we receive feedback from every single situation &#x2014; when we submit manuscripts, we receive feedback from the editors and peer reviewers. When we submit grants, we receive feedback from NSF and NIH panelists. When we defend or give our qualifying examinations, we get feedback from our committee members and those who listen to us. When we go up for tenure, we get feedback from the tenure committee. Every basic interaction between lab colleagues allows us to refine and change our ideas and methods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So why is it that admissions, perhaps the most critical part of one&#8217;s journey to becoming a scientist, has to be the most Kafkaesque process? Departments at Stanford have policies that they will not release feedback about their decisions to students. Let me again point out how asinine that is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As scientists, we strive for clarity, reproducibility and evidence &#x2014; if there is no clear criteria for those who are admitted and those who are not, we are creating a game of chance, an unequal opportunity between those who understand the &#x201C;game&#x201D; and those who do not.&nbsp; For many of us who have been admitted, it is a case of survivorship bias; we may not care about what our interviewers thought &#x2014; we got in.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the reality is that there are hundreds of others who haven&#x2019;t gotten in &#x2014; there is about a 10% acceptance rate in my department. For many of them, who passed the initial screening and reached the interview stage, having that extra feedback from the professors who spent the time interacting with the applicant will go a long way in helping their futures in other grad school interviews, or in general become better at the interview process. By denying all of this, growth is stunted.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In particular, this unduly affects groups who are less likely to understand the &#x201C;game&#x201D; &#x2014; first-time higher education seekers, immigrants, people of color and people from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, as evidenced by the Department of Education&#x2019;s own <a href=\"https:\/\/www2.ed.gov\/rschstat\/research\/pubs\/advancing-diversity-inclusion.pdf\">report<\/a> on higher education statistics.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some may argue that people do not have time to respond to the potentially hundreds of applicants. However, federal grant agencies illustrate that it is possible to make the time; many national grant agencies, in particular NSF and NIH, return grant feedback to submitters. If federal grant agencies and reviewers can afford to spend time to give feedback, so can admissions committees. While departments may view giving feedback as an inefficient waste of time and resources, I would argue such feedback is valuable in the long term. Using the departments&#x2019; logic, growing a tree is a waste of time. It may be &#x201C;inefficient&#x201D; to take time out of our busy lives to water it, but over 50 years, when we are long gone, that tree will provide shade for those who didn&#x2019;t have it before. We do not see the tree grow day to day, but if we do not water it daily, the tree will die before it has a chance to rise. In the same way, by not giving the applicants feedback, we are failing potential scientists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A perhaps darker interpretation can be taken that the lack of feedback and clarity is useful for maintaining a sense of &#x201C;prestige&#x201D; in the institution. It would be a lie to say that we don&#x2019;t profit from this idea; a degree from Stanford opens up so many opportunities because of its exclusivity. Antonio Gramsci, an Italian 20th century political prisoner under Benito Mussolini, defined this as the idea of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/title\/prison-notebooks\/oclc\/24009547\">cultural hegemony<\/a> &#x2014; the ruling class&#x2019;s beliefs, thoughts and expectations become the dominant accepted cultural norm in a culturally diverse society. We are lucky that we have the choice to not perpetuate this hegemony; let us use this to enact change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is easy to enact policies at the top of the chain to promote better representation; the real challenge starts at the roots so that more trees have a chance to grow. We have to rethink how graduate school admissions works, and really provide equitable opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it is important for us to take this issue up with our departments here. For the small number of us currently in the program, we will not see any benefit from it, but I guarantee you, thousands will thank us for it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Soham Sinha argues that departments should provide feedback to graduate school applicants. &#8220;As scientists we strive for clarity,

He focuses on the health impacts of climate change and the co-benefits of a sustainable and just energy transition.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, Stanford leadership has gestured toward an interest in environmental justice (EJ). This December, university leaders took an important step in launching the EJ Cluster Hire &#x2014; originally proposed by the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ejstanford.com\/\"> Stanford EJ Working Group<\/a> in 2018 and widely supported by the Stanford community. The goal is to fill a glaring gap: despite environmental justice being necessary to achieving a sustainable society, we have no environmental justice scholars on the Academic Council Stanford faculty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet through candidate interviews during campus visits (the EJ Working Group had no other role in the search), we learned that only one out of eleven interviewees self-identified as an environmental justice scholar. The vast majority of interviewees could not name an EJ scholar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We assert that this search cannot be constituted as the long-awaited &#x201C;EJ Cluster Hire.&#x201D; Further, we are highly concerned that Stanford appears willing to co-opt the words &#x201C;Environmental Justice&#x201D; without making a commitment to an established field of scholarship. To make this right, we need an intentional Environmental Justice cluster hire that is dedicated to expanding EJ expertise in the newly-minted Doerr School of Sustainability.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the spirit of repair, we have brought these concerns to new school leadership. During a sit-down interview with students a few weeks ago, Dean Arun Majumdar told us (on the record), &#x201C;You have my commitment that we will be looking at EJ, we will be hiring, and you will have the deep engagement that is necessary and the input from the EJ Working Group. That I can commit to.&#x201D;&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have heard similar statements before. We urge Dean Majumdar to reinvest in environmental justice as the foundation for true sustainability. Indeed, the Doerr School launch presents a unique opportunity to learn from Stanford&#x2019;s mistakes, create meaningful space for EJ and move us towards a just transition beyond fossil fuels. Can the Doerr School of Sustainability commit to visionary investments beyond big oil? Can the new school&#x2019;s leadership commit to investing in the knowledge and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ejstanford.com\/indigenous-leadership-in-the-emerging-green-economy.html\">expertise of frontline communities<\/a>?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This commitment is essential because achieving sustainability requires attending to the deep divisions and disparities that persist within and across societies. If we are not prioritizing environmental justice as a key framework that encourages research-to-action approaches that engage with the root causes of inequities and racialized oppression linked to environmental degradation, we will fail in our sustainability efforts. Yet with scholarly frameworks from EJ, our students gain the intellectual structures, research methodologies, and ethical understandings they need to avoid reproducing injustice when they go out into the world to &#x201C;solve&#x201D; sustainability problems that are deeply connected to ongoing histories of racialized discrimination, dispossession and injustice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>EJ scholarship extends beyond engaging with issues of inequality through policy or economic methods. Rather, it is an area of scholarship that centers the experiences, leadership and agency of frontline communities in research.<strong> <\/strong>According to this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teachingej.com\/about-us\/\">national EJ teaching and education database<\/a> coordinated by members of Stanford&#x2019;s Environmental Justice Working Group and additional partners, it &#x201C;is a framework at the nexus of social movements and research that centers the leadership and expertise of BIPOC [Black Indigenous People of Color] voices as it makes intersectional connections between painful histories of environmental racism and processes and practices of rebuilding a more equitable, healthy and safer world.&#x201D; As with other fields of research, EJ scholarship is rooted in a set of methodologies, literature and research traditions that are mutually recognized among EJ scholars and practitioners. These traditions have been established through the groundbreaking research of Robert Bullard, together with many others, as well as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ucc.org\/what-we-do\/justice-local-church-ministries\/justice\/faithful-action-ministries\/environmental-justice\/principles_of_environmental_justice\/\">EJ principles<\/a> set by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ucc.org\/30th-anniversary-the-first-national-people-of-color-environmental-leadership-summit\/\">First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While a true EJ cluster hire at Stanford would be a powerful step for our institution, Stanford will not be the first to attempt to fill this gap. We can look to President Biden&#x2019;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefing-room\/presidential-actions\/2021\/01\/20\/executive-order-protecting-public-health-and-environment-and-restoring-science-to-tackle-climate-crisis\/\">early directives<\/a> centering environmental justice and through the creation of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/environmentaljustice\/white-house-environmental-justice-advisory-council\">White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council<\/a>. We can even look to Stanford&#x2019;s peer institutions for guidance. Late last year, Berkeley <a href=\"https:\/\/www.diverseeducation.com\/faculty-staff\/article\/15114439\/new-cluster-hires-at-uc-berkeley-all-of-different-disciplines-will-focus-on-climate-equity\">successfully completed<\/a> its Climate Equity and Environmental Justice search, bringing on five scholars. Berkeley has also committed to cross-department cluster hires on issues relating to Native American and Indigenous People, Anti-Black Racism and Social Inclusion, Latinx and Democracy, Artificial Intelligence and Inequality and Understanding (Non) Citizenship. The new Yale School of the Environment <a href=\"https:\/\/environment.yale.edu\/news\/article\/dorceta-taylor-preeminent-environmental-justice-scholar-returns-to-yale\">recently hired<\/a> Dorceta Taylor, a preeminent EJ scholar; <a href=\"https:\/\/ycej.yale.edu\/en\/people\/gerald-torres\">Gerald Torres<\/a> is also a professor of Environmental Justice on Yale&#x2019;s faculty. Washington University St. Louis has an <a href=\"https:\/\/biology.wustl.edu\/news\/environmental-justice-cluster-three-assistant-professor-positions\">ongoing EJ-only<\/a> cluster hire, and the University of San Diego is also running a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sandiego.edu\/cas\/about\/diversity-equity-inclusion\/hiring.php\">cluster hire<\/a> with an EJ focus, among other institutions.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Moving forward, leadership should reinvest in a real, EJ-only cluster hire.<\/strong> This requires acknowledging that the recent cluster hire does not include environmental justice scholars. An EJ cluster hire cannot be EJ in name alone, but must reflect EJ values and be tailored specifically to EJ scholarship. Further, the hire would ideally follow best practices for diversity, equity and inclusion hires. Dean Majumdar need only engage directly with the students, staff and faculty who have been working to bring EJ to Stanford for years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we bring together diverse thinkers on campus to create the new school and to address complex problems like climate change &#x2014; known to create disproportionate levels of harm for historically marginalized communities &#x2014;&#xA0;we need EJ-centered leadership at the table in decision-making and policy-making. Lacking this, our leadership risks reproducing harm in the form of extractive research and policies that reinscribe disproportionate harm to historically marginalized communities of color.

we stand"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p><em>Jack Golub graduated Stanford in 2020. He now teaches English in Austin, Texas. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Classes of 2020 and 2021 (and perhaps even 2022),<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I left Stanford and became a teacher. My school is pretty different from Stanford, though. A lot of the students never pay attention. Our principal is a bit, uh, robotic. We don&#x2019;t treat our custodial staff as an integral part of our school community&#x2026; Alright, perhaps not as different as I thought.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In all seriousness, Stanford is different. At Stanford, I struggled. I often felt listless and confused. Spring quarter I&#x2019;d usually get a little depressed. I guess getting drunk at 11 a.m. just didn&#x2019;t do it for me. But I felt loved. I felt loved and supported by my peers, right from the start. My frosh year, half the dorm tried to help me learn CS106A. That they failed is irrelevant. My junior year, as an RA, I was down bad at times. My friends reached out to me. They came to see me. They listened, even when I had nothing to say. At Stanford, I felt confident that the people around me had my back. I knew my administration had the resources to provide me with an unparalleled education, including a daily menu of rich cultural events.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I largely felt that my Stanford journey lived up to our motto, &#x201C;let the winds of freedom blow.&#x201D; I was given a gift that let me grow. Not everyone gets that gift.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I currently teach seventh grade in Austin, Texas. I chose to teach because I thought I could connect deeply with students and uncover, for them to see, a surprisingly vast potential. Uvalde sits only a couple hours away from my school.&nbsp;Since May 24, grief and anger have stolen my thoughts. I have felt lost. I cried in front of my students as I lied to them, telling them that I would protect them no matter what, all while knowing that my body won&#x2019;t beat an AR-15. I have felt small. I needed to remind myself that we, recent and new Stanford graduates, stand on the shoulders of giants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand on the shoulders of the strong and loving Muwekma Ohlone tribe, a people who have survived and continue to survive colonialism and white supremacy. They are capable of such strength that they continue to love this sacred land, where they have lived for thousands of years, at every cost.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand with conviction on the shoulders of bell hooks, whose fierce voice for justice still resonates in her absence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand expressively, and yes, securely, on the shoulders of Issa Rae.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand in all-white Air-Force 1s on the shoulders of Phil Knight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand thousands of miles beyond earth on the shoulders of Mae Jemison and Sally Ride.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand on the physically less imposing yet altogether revolutionary shoulders of Sergey Brin and Larry Page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand bravely, ready to speak truth to power, on the shoulders of Christine Blasey Ford.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand on the shoulders of Stanford luminaries. Shoulders that are daunting in their size and, sometimes, in their shortcomings. To recognize how big we are, we must acknowledge both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand on the shoulders of the first president of Stanford, David Starr Jordan: pioneering psychologist, strategic president and prominent eugenicist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand on Leland Stanford&#x2019;s shoulders. Our founder who was ahead of his time in creating a coed school loosened from some constraints of established gender norms. He built this school with money made from exploiting Chinese railroad workers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have been poured into by our families and this school. Our teachers in the front of the room, our teachers sitting alongside us, our teachers serving us food, our teachers cleaning our bathrooms and those teachers calling us, asking when next are we coming home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2020 and 2021, we stand here, now, at the perfect time. We are not eager to burst forth, filled with passion and optimism, onto a broken world awaiting our leadership. We are not looking ahead to what doors this Stanford degree will open for us in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the future. We are already here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have learned that those doors won&#x2019;t magically open. Sometimes, the task of taking care of ourselves is more than enough for one day. The amazing future of fulfillment and powerful change that we normally would be promised during this weekend has, for many of us, not quite arrived on time. Maybe it got stuck in the Tresidder mail office. The line looks long, and I don&#x2019;t have my ID card anymore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I won&#x2019;t pretend that our good intentions and intelligence are enough. I won&#x2019;t ask for a moment of silence so that we can acknowledge our grief and then move on. The change we desperately need in the world won&#x2019;t happen until we change ourselves. Until we realize, collectively, that we have been given a gift that can never be earned or repaid. We stand so high, on such grand and great shoulders, such flawed shoulders, that we cannot come down. We are here to stay. Whatever we do with the power of our knowledge and our relationships furthers the legacy of this school. For better or for worse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of us have already begun honoring this gift. Since March 2020, we have learned of the courageous and creative capacities we hold within. When Stanford abruptly kicked us off campus we instinctively thought of others. We built a robust mutual aid network in mere days. One of us mobilized neighborhood helpers to deliver groceries to those that couldn&#x2019;t get them, literally feeding the hungry. Another assembled a team across the country to design and sell clothing and use the proceeds to buy crucial baby care items that parents and foster parents could not afford. Others of us served in less visible ways. We took care of, even homeschooled younger siblings. We helped family members and friends leave dangerous relationships and battle sickness. We started therapy to become better at loving one another, at loving ourselves. We survived after losing people dear to us. Finally, and this is true, one of us quit Goldman Sachs after only four weeks on the job.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The time to change our expectations of ourselves is not today. This whole weekend is the time to remember and celebrate and give thanks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To remember late nights in the lounge. The shock, which turned to thrill, then eventually irritation at roll outs. The relief at finishing finals followed by the bumbling camaraderie of Nomad. The randomly sunny, 80-degree winter days spent lounging, spike balling and pretending to do work. Those two weeks in 2017 where everyone simultaneously discovered Polo y Pan. The amazement of our first time at Gaieties. The, for some of us, sloppier enjoyment of all the other Gaieties. And, for a few of us, our naked prancing across the stage of our final Gaieties.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To celebrate that we did something difficult together. The challenges we overcame &#x2014; all those late nights in Green Library working on p-sets (I actually can&#x2019;t relate to that one; thank you, humanities), speakers antagonizing us yearly with their false narratives of Christian nationalism, COVID. The moments of triumph &#x2014; the band getting un-banned, securing pay raises for student staff, that moment during every Common Origins performance where all five hundred members are on stage at once and you&#x2019;re thinking to yourself, &#x201C;How is this possible?&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To give thanks that the frantic hallway goodbyes of March 2020 were not permanent. Thanks for the teachers and other staff who believed in us and challenged us in equal measure. For our frosh communities. For the creative writing classes that make everyone who takes them feel like we have something important to share. For the glorious culmination of fellowship that we call Special D. For the relentless student activists who showed us how bright our inner lights can shine in moments of crisis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today is the time to remind ourselves of the gift we have received.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomorrow is the time to change. To do the uncomfortable, setback-ridden work of loving one another more. To push our professional efforts, no matter what we do and especially if it seems unrelated to our society&#x2019;s challenges, closer towards justice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To stay humble and continue to fulfill this tremendously powerful gift.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomorrow, and every day after it, is the time to use that gift.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that one of my students makes it into Stanford.

This was the topic of my college admissions essays and the mentality that took me on a trans-Atlantic journey to study in the United States. As a 12-year-old schoolgirl I was asked where I dreamed of attending university, and I shyly replied with the name of the nearest big city to my hometown in England. The smiling adult was suitably impressed, but I remember thinking to myself &#x2014; imagine their response if they knew the truth. I want to attend university in California.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s difficult to pinpoint exactly when or where the dream started, but this was the moment when I decided for myself to turn this dream into a plan. I was probably inspired in the early days by &#x201C;High School Musical&#x201D; or some other Disney Channel fantasy filled with cheerleaders, dancing on the tables during lunch break, and teenagers wearing their <em>own clothes <\/em>instead of a school uniform. But on reflection, there was something more about California that called out to me. I pictured a way of life where my disability would cease to be a barrier due to the warmer climate and relative accessibility of the environment compared to the ancient architecture of the U.K. I fantasized about rolling along smooth, wide boulevards in my powered wheelchair and basking in the independence that a college campus would afford me. I was enchanted by the idea of being different for some reason other than my disability, relishing in the prospect of small talk about my accent and growing up in a quaint British town. As I felt increasingly isolated from my school friends because of my physical limitations, I longed for a taste of acceptance and believed America held the answer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I thrive on having a goal and I knew what I had to do to put my plans into action. Learning was something I excelled at and getting good grades was the only option. My anxieties about fitting in among my peers faded because I had my sights set somewhere beyond high school, and I accepted not being able to go out and socialize in the same way as everyone else because I was using that time to get where I wanted more than anything to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I developed the confidence to share my ambitions, I learned that it&#x2019;s okay for people not to believe in you. In part, their laughter at my plans energized me because I knew that I was about to prove them all wrong. At the precise moment my parents were told I would not survive beyond the age of six, my life became all about defying the odds. One by one, I worked through the list of components that would make studying abroad possible: academic achievement, impressive extracurriculars, generous financial aid, access to robust healthcare, complex travel logistics for my powered wheelchair, funding for 24\/7 caregivers to enable me to pursue an education outside of my home country &#x2026; the list goes on. I had never spent more than a weekend away from my parents, so the greatest hurdle of all was trusting each other that I could do this independently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The desire to prove myself was ingrained in me from an early age, in part as a character trait and in part as a manifestation of my internalized ableism. For my life to have value, nothing I ever did could be mediocre. Studying in the U.S. was the ultimate symbol of overcoming my disability, and the fact that I got into Stanford was the icing on the cake.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">***<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With graduation only a few days away, I can confidently say that my time at Stanford has been extraordinary. But as is often the case, it has been so in the most unexpected of ways.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Academically, not only have I majored in a field that I never once considered prior to my sophomore year, but I have grown in my appreciation of knowledge for knowledge&#x2019;s sake rather than focusing on education as primarily a means to an end. I gradually learned that fulfillment would come from enrolling in classes that I actually wanted to take &#x2014; not those I felt I ought to &#x2014; and I ultimately carved out a learning experience that has been truly authentic to my passions. Most unexpectedly of all, I found myself in Oxford courtesy of BOSP and the COVID-19 pandemic, and it was there that I first began to believe in myself as a real scholar, discovering an academic niche that went on to shape the latter half of my Stanford experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the people I have been lucky enough to meet along the way, I would have to agree with the majority of students when they say that the people here are the best thing about Stanford. I arrived as a freshman craving social connection, but quickly realized that forming relationships was an evolving process that required me to step out of my comfort zone and tap into a vulnerability that I had been so averse to all my life. It wasn&#x2019;t just going to happen for me &#x2014; <em>even in America<\/em>. Despite this yearning for social bonds, I spent years convincing myself that I would be fine either way because I had goals that I was intent on achieving, but I now recognize wholeheartedly that when everything else is falling apart, my social ties and points of meaningful connection are what keep me afloat. I have found friendships that teach me new things about myself every day, and I am eternally grateful for their acceptance of me in all my strength and fragility. They have shown me that I bring value as a friend too, helping me drown out the voice that &#x2014; echoed by a society that sees people with disabilities as disabled first and human only second &#x2014; insists otherwise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, I came to Stanford seeking an escape from my disabled self, but in reality I have experienced the exact opposite. In some ways the everyday challenges of college life have brought my disability into sharper focus than ever before, and in certain moments I have found myself just longing for the ability to walk so that I would not have to spend another day facing institutional inaccessibility and &#x2014; you guessed it &#x2014; a lack of wheelchair accessible transport. What these moments have shown me, however, is that I can be more honest with myself about my experience with disability, and I hope that my writing today is a testament to that. Finding connection and belonging in the disability community at Stanford has encouraged me not to run from but to embrace this part of my identity, and I have learned to use advocacy for myself and others as a source of power. Despite my best intentions, Stanford has helped me grow into my disability, but I will leave this campus as a more complete version of myself because of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">***<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Graduation has come around far too quickly, and I have never been good at saying goodbye. I could write a book about the incredible experiences and opportunities that have defined my Stanford experience in so many unique and wonderful ways, but that&#x2019;s not what this column is about. At The Daily, writing about disability has been my &#x2018;thing,&#x2019; so, as a final farewell, I wanted to write candidly about how I have experienced Stanford &#x2014; from beginning to end &#x2014; through the lens of my disability. It certainly wasn&#x2019;t perfect, but looking back I hardly recognize my freshman self for all the best reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The page has turned and the next chapter is dawning &#x2014; onto sunny LA because this Cali girl isn&#x2019;t going anywhere! &#x2014; but as I leave this campus behind for now, I am most grateful to Stanford for showing me the true meaning of <em>extraordinary<\/em>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;Graduation has come around far too quickly, and I have never been good at saying goodbye,&#8221; writes Tilly Griffiths. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1002036,"featured_media":1205507,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[24],"tags":[567,19139,6687,5309,738,5268,78201],"site-layouts":[],"coauthors":[51801],"parsely":{"version":"1.1.0","meta":{"@context":"https:\/\/schema.org","@type":"NewsArticle","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/08\/griffiths-thanks-stanford-its-been-extraordinary\/"},"headline":"Griffiths | Thanks, Stanford.

Probably because my whole life, people have been telling me how wonderful I am.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was my grandparents&#x2019; first grandchild, a precocious little girl with a pair of lungs that would give DJ Khaled a run for his money. In elementary school, I was writing my first several novels (and plays that I acted out for my family in the living room). I was then accepted into a prestigious middle school that you had to test into, I went to the same high school that Timothee Chalamet and Nicki Minaj went to and I got into Stanford Fucking University.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#x2019;m not saying I went into Stanford thinking I was hot shit &#x2026; but I went into Stanford thinking I was hot shit. My first reality check came when I walked into my first class on the first day, and found out that economics isn&#x2019;t just the study of how to do taxes (which might seem like common knowledge to you but was a harsh realization for me). But then somehow freshman year just turned into a series of revelations that I&#x2019;m NoT aS sPeCiAl As My MoM tOlD mE i WaS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>I had to switch Econ 1 to credit\/no credit because I was, how shall I say, <em>failing all of my p-sets and tests.<\/em><\/li><li>I auditioned for the plays &#8220;Lulu,&#8221; &#8220;The Seagull,&#8221; &#8220;The Panza Monologues,&#8221; &#8220;Godot Has Come&#8221; and &#8220;Stupid Fucking Bird,&#8221;<em> <\/em>all of which I was ~rejected from~.<\/li><li>I tried out for the Stanford mock trial team, because I was something of a mock trial goddess in high school, and then I was ~promptly rejected from that too~.<\/li><li>I applied to literally spend my weekends helping plan Stanford&#x2019;s Admit Weekend for incoming freshmen, and my application got ~denied~.<\/li><li>I got my first B winter quarter after <em>locking myself in my room for an entire 12-hour day to write a 15-page final paper in which I literally wrote down and justified arguments I did not agree with because I knew the professor agreed with them.<\/em><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know it might seem like I&#x2019;m making light of all these failures (probably because I when I&#x2019;m upset I deflectttt it with humorrrr), but after a while, the waterworks and phone calls home became a not infrequent occurrence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But although Stanford had taken a lot of things from me &#x2014; my scholastic aptitude, my talent for acting, my ability to present well in my resum&#xE9; and in my academic writing &#x2014; there was one thing Stanford had left untouched: my appearance. Although I felt like an incompetent, untalented dimwit, at least I still felt like a <em>hot<\/em> incompetent, untalented dimwit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I felt this way, I decided that I had nothing to lose in asking out a cute boy from one of my classes. He was unlike all of the boys I had ever dated before &#x2014; smart, literate, decent &#x2014; and although he was a little nerdier-looking than the boys I would normally go for, under those thick-brimmed glasses lay a very conventionally handsome face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one day, I waited for him after class (which happened to be the one day where instead of jetting out of the building and back to his dorm, he stayed behind to talk to the professor just so that in waiting outside for him I would look ~that much creepier~), and asked if I could talk to him for a moment. (One of the really lucky things I got to experience that day was what it would feel like to have a heart attack. In the moments before he emerged from the building, my heart was beating so fast that I feared it would be visible through my clothes, and sweat was pooling up all hither and thither.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The boy said yes, and honestly, I had been so worried about how exactly I should phrase the question, and exactly how long the pause would be before he gave an answer, and what the answer would even be, that I had completely neglected to imagine what it would be like if he said yes. But he did, and then there was a long pause because I hadn&#x2019;t prepared what to say next &#x2026; and then he goes, &#x201C;so &#x2026; should we exchange numbers?&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we exchanged numbers, and eventually we decided on a time and place. But when I received a text message that day asking to postpone, and as that day (and many others) came and went, it became evident that all the time I had devoted to researching the &#x201C;top ten most breathtaking wedding destinations&#x201D; &#x2026; might have been a little premature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From then on, I became hypersensitive to the way he and I did not interact in class, and how he continued to book it out of the building after every lesson. And I began to feel so stupid &#x2014; how could I have been naive enough to build up this love story in my head when it was clearly totally one-sided?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then I realized that perhaps fathoming that a boy I was interested in might not be interested in me &#x2026; wasn&#x2019;t all that crazy. In a world of 8 billion people, it was always going to be a 50\/50 toss-up <s>that he would be the type of person capable of appreciating my devastating beauty or the type of person who is blind<\/s>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past four years, I have wrestled with this concept of self-worth. As Stanford students, I think many of us have grown up accustomed to external validation &#x2014; whether those be grades, or awards, or college admissions. There is so much temptation to view our self-worth through the lens of these accolades. But when I think about the incredible people I&#x2019;ve met at Stanford &#x2014; my best friends &#x2014; none of this factors into what make them impressive to me. Rather, my best friends are kind, they&#x2019;re compassionate, they&#x2019;re funny, dependable, courageous and resilient. It just so happens that they can also speak a million languages and hack into the mainframe and all that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#x2019;m a senior now, and what I&#x2019;ve learned from my time at Stanford is this: we mustn&#x2019;t feel that we are entitled to anything &#x2014; to admission into a club, to a good grade, to a boy. For not only does entitlement lead us to calamity when things don&#x2019;t go our way, but it also encourages us not to work hard for things. While being able to appreciate our strengths leads us to be the self-assured, confident individuals that Stanford admissions officers seek to admit, ignoring our imperfection makes us ill fit to handle the real world, where people aren&#x2019;t always going to see us the way our moms do.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Alexa Gold discusses how her Stanford experience has affected her view of self-worth. &#8220;So I\u2019m not saying I went into Stanford thinking I was hot shit \u2026 but I went into Stanford thinking I was hot shit.

You have always made sure to blaze your own trails, but I am so excited that we will both be able to call this wonderful, complicated place home. And I know Stanford is excited about the better Martinez-Krams.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The campus looks and feels so different now from when I first stepped onto campus as a student four years ago. There were no neighborhoods, masking guidelines or Barrillaga. My dorm, Freshman Sophomore College, no longer exists. When I was interviewed on a radio show before an Oregon State vs. Stanford baseball series, I could proudly say that The Stanford Daily was still a daily.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember telling you that I joined The Daily and how I won the lottery. Bobby Pragada &#x2019;19 pulled my name out of a hat, randomly placing me in the press box next to King Jemison &#x2019;21 for a Stanford football game day. I asked King what to wear, what to bring and how to write about Stanford&#x2019;s collapse against Utah, but the best advice I received that night came as we left the press conference and walked across the south end zone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Do you want a picture?&#x201D; King asked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;No, I&#x2019;m okay,&#x201D; I told him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Are you sure?&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Well, I guess.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The picture was on my Instagram story a few hours later and still serves as my Twitter cover photo. I stopped to smell the roses, commemorating what became my first of three seasons covering football for The Daily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I appreciated the moment when I announced women&#x2019;s soccer in North Carolina on KZSU 90.1 FM, as mommies texted me material to discuss during a 30-minute delay. I glowed when I interviewed <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2018\/11\/01\/preseason-qa-with-womens-basketball-head-coach-tara-vanderveer\/\">Tara VanDerveer<\/a> for the first time. I texted our family group chat in awe as soon as I finished my interview with <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2019\/04\/26\/final-at-manuel-ledecky-highlight-ninth-episode-of-laughter-permitted-with-julie-foudy\/\">Julie Foudy<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I faltered as well. I watched from the right field press area at Sunken Diamond during the NCAA regional tournament and envisioned returning to the spot in a year. I wish I had paused that moment. The pandemic wiped out the entire tournament, and I was back home living with you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is so easy to rush through college thinking of what is ahead. When taking out your pencil for a Monday morning lecture, it is easy to dream of a Friday afternoon nap. But if you rush through that week, you won&#x2019;t enjoy the Stern burrito bowls on Tuesday, the friend with a nice smile in your Wednesday morning section or the sunset over Hoover Tower on Thursday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It took me a while to grasp this, especially in my writing. You can read back through my early stories and know everything that happened on the field or the court, and nothing that happened outside the lines. Eventually, though, I began to capture the people in the story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2019\/05\/16\/from-the-farm-to-france-three-former-stanford-players-prepare-for-womens-world-cup\/\">Cybele Zhang and I<\/a> wrote about the Stanford players on the U.S. women&#x2019;s national team, and then you and I traveled to France and <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2019\/07\/06\/after-toppling-england-uswnt-to-play-netherlands-in-world-cup-finals\/\">your photograph<\/a> appeared in The Daily. I wrote about the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2021\/02\/27\/the-two-people-bringing-sound-to-maples\/\">people making noise<\/a> in a fan-less Maples Pavilion. I asked players, coaches and media members about Tara VanDerveer&#x2019;s <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/12\/14\/tara-vanderveer-history\/\">1,098 wins<\/a>. I told the story of the football team <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/12\/10\/football-practice-in-park\/\">practicing in the park<\/a>. I found <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/06\/03\/why-i-kneel\/\">my voice<\/a> amid tragedy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am so thankful for the many people who helped me outside The Daily. Nick Sako wrapped me with his parka when I was shivering from the postgame cold as I interviewed David Esquer &#x2019;87 in shorts and a short sleeve shirt. Janie McCauley and I shared desserts in empty arenas, as she shared tips about how to humanize my stories. Jacob Rayburn inspired me with his writing and understanding of an entire campus&#x2019;s worth of athletics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you know, I played club baseball at Stanford. Throughout my whole life, I wanted to end on a good swing whenever I practiced, and I would ask for &#x201C;one more&#x201D; until I got it. This year, I stopped asking for &#x201C;one more.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I looked at the calendar and realized this was my final year playing baseball. Instead of relying on &#x201C;one more&#x201D; swing to fix my mistakes, I treated every day on the field as my last.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, when I caught COVID and isolated while my team played in the regional tournament in Lancaster, I grieved having to follow along on GameChanger, but I knew that I made my last swing my best.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will never know when you will be doing something for the last time. You may go to TAP once a week until you spend your last dining dollars and never order another Pac-12 Burger. You will celebrate turning in your week 10 Math 51 problem set, knowing you will never take another math class. Once, I waved goodbye to sophomore year friends, not knowing the pandemic would delay our next hello by two years.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I learned to appreciate every moment. I am so excited about yours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Love,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Daniel<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Daniel Martinez-Krams reflects on learning to live in the moment. &#8220;It is so easy to rush through college thinking of what is ahead.

| Rituals"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>I took an extra long winter break this year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With classes moved online for the first few weeks of the quarter, I decided to stay home in Los Angeles. The extra time led me to looking through stacks and stacks of family photo albums, and one childhood photo of myself, in particular. I&#x2019;m two years old or so, wearing socks and sandals, standing in the yard at home and clutching the day&#x2019;s newspaper. Unfolded, the paper itself was probably as big as I was.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#x2019;t remember this precise photo being taken, but returning to the image nevertheless brought to mind a rush of other memories. Growing up, my Sunday mornings began with the LA Times. For as long as I can remember, my dad and I would head down Franklin Avenue to the neighborhood grocery store and pick up a copy of the weekend edition. (The rare occasion that I was able to pay for the newspaper myself with the spare quarters in my pocket made me feel very adult.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was our ritual. Coming home, newspaper in hand, and sitting around the dining table to read the sports section.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was home.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ritual, however, is probably not a word I would have used to describe this routine until I got to Stanford and realized just how impactful these Sunday mornings were. Last fall, I took ENGLISH 180A: &#8220;Periodicity&#8221; &#x2014; an early modern literature class that, among other topics, explores the inception of the English periodical in the eighteenth century. In one text that struck a particular cord with me, Kevis Goodman describes the ritualization of news consumption that envisions a routine mass ceremony, where readers look to the news each morning and night simultaneously. He writes, &#x201C;The significance of this mass ceremony &#x2014; [Georg Wilhelm Friedrich] Hegel observed that newspapers serve modern man as a substitute for morning prayers &#x2014; is paradoxical. It is performed in silent privacy, in the lair of the skull. Yet each communicant is well aware that the ceremony he performs is being replicated simultaneously by thousands (or millions) of others.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the same sort of communion that I had experienced growing up &#x2014; not just the action of reading itself, but the corresponding community and collective consciousness that it brought. Although, of course, the means of our news consumption continues to change into the 21st century, that very sentiment &#x2014; the mutual forging of reasoning and understanding among the public &#x2014; is what prompted me to join The Daily and what has kept me around for four years.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This ritual of news production and consumption, especially sports reporting, has spanned my entire Stanford experience and perhaps facilitated some of the most meaningful connections I&#x2019;ve made.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before even enrolling as a student, The Stanford Daily brought me community. In a makeshift high school reunion over Admit Weekend, Sarah Wishingrad (then a graduating Stanford senior) encouraged me to join The Daily, recounting on Meyer Green her own fond memories over the past four years.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward five months, and Bobby Pragada was enthusiastically convincing me to choose the sports section over a table at the activities fair.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And soon enough I had found a new, just as meaningful, ritual.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of reading about USC football with my parents, it was editing Jack Golub&#x2019;s column with him in Soto at 2 a.m., attending midweek football press conferences and walking to Treehouse to pick up pizza for production. Most nights, the routine, however, was just arguing that we print a sports article on the front page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without Claire Wang&#x2019;s willingness to take a chance on me as a freshman managing editor, I probably would not have bonded with my roommate in the same depth. My roommate played varsity lacrosse (a sport totally foreign to this Angeleno), so when tasked with editing coverage of the Stanford team, I asked her to explain the ins and outs of the sports she loved. Those conversations, with me sitting on my bed and her across the narrow dorm room on hers, or similar ones with my student-athlete friends Mason Gonzalez and Allie Jones, among others, brought us all closer over the course of the school year. Through these friendships, I forged another layer of my Stanford routine.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing and editing, especially as I assimilated to Stanford during my freshman year, gave me a sense of purpose, focus and community &#x2014; both within and beyond 456 Panama Mall. As a leader in a traditionally male section and traditionally male field at-large, perhaps the most important personal takeaway of working as a sports journalist and editor was harnessing my voice. Often the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/12\/21\/zhang-the-boys-club\/\">only woman in the room<\/a> (and probably the youngest, too), I had to advocate for myself and what I believed in. Perhaps that was construed as being insubordinate at times, but I would like to think that my presence and efforts helped other women carve out their own places in the sports journalism world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The necessity of speaking out and writing&#x2019;s potential to prompt change became especially apparent during my coverage of <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/11\/22\/36-sports-strong\/\">36 Sports Strong <\/a>and, in particular, the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/07\/13\/sports-game-point-1\/\">men&#x2019;s volleyball team&#x2019;s <\/a>efforts to save their program. Speaking to players and alumni showed me in practice the way that journalism could bring people together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But hearing about the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/07\/08\/sports-cancellations\/\">intended cuts<\/a>, simultaneous to sports around the country being put on hold <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/08\/11\/sports-football-cancelled\/\">due to the pandemic<\/a>, also made me realize how devastated I would be if a team\/club\/organization that I cared about was suddenly defunct or out of reach. More than anything, it made me appreciate the people, routines and laughs that The Daily has brought me. I&#x2019;ll take those memories with me, like the childhood photo albums, long after I leave this university &#x2014; freshman year autograph sessions after my full-page graphic on the baseball team and muddy Ink Bowl Games and headline games and Zoom Kahoots and breaking down Pac-12 football in EVGR with Daniel Martinez-Krams and interviews outside Jimmy V&#x2019;s with Zach Zafran and weekends at the beach with Tammer Bagdasarian and Cooper Veit and Drew Silva&#x2019;s NFL jerseys as we wait for TAP on Draft Day and FloVolleyball games with Madeline Grabb and trivia nights with Benjamin Zaidel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I decided at the start of my senior year that I would save a printed copy of each week&#x2019;s Stanford Daily so that, by graduation in June, I would have a journalistic record of my final year on campus. So, in packing up my undergraduate dorm room for the final time, I find myself in an oddly familiar position.

last August, I was underwhelmed. Like Lorde <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/08\/03\/arts\/music\/lorde-solar-power.html\">herself<\/a>, I had expected this release to be a &#x201C;big acid record&#x201D; &#x2014; showing up the synth angst of &#x201C;Pure Heroine&#x201D; and the museum magic of &#x201C;Melodrama&#x201D; with the shock and awe of a meteor shower.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, we got a first single that many found fitting for a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AbeoRobinson\/status\/1435770964516638722\">tampon commercial<\/a>. The intense instrumental breakdowns of tracks like &#x201C;Glory and Gore&#x201D; and &#x201C;Supercut&#x201D; were replaced by a leisurely 12-string guitar and a voice like farmer&#x2019;s market honey. Like its eponymous song, &#x201C;Solar Power&#x201D; instead turned out something like a &#x201C;weed album.&#x201D; It was playful. Meandering. Mild, even.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some complained that they were still too caught up in their &#x201C;Melodrama&#x201D; eras to appreciate this album, I felt like I hadn&#x2019;t even gotten past &#x201C;Pure Heroine.&#x201D; I was the overgrown suburban child who still drank orange juice and cried about growing up. Meanwhile, a 25-year-old Kiwi was telling me to get a grip. Not every song had to strike you to the bone, not every day would feel like cataclysm and not every day was a tick on a time bomb. Most of the time, Lorde seemed to say, life wasn&#x2019;t so extreme.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the kind of intense person who could never quite land the &#x201C;cool girl&#x201D; act, it was hard for me to learn to be temperate. I&#x2019;d long been familiar with debilitating grief, totalizing sadness, all-consuming infatuation; but I didn&#x2019;t know the grey emotions, the stretches between those poles.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, I spent a lot of time in grey.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scholarships I&#x2019;d poured every last drop of myself into seeped through my hands. People I&#x2019;d loved unconditionally established their conditions. Nothing on this campus felt the same as when we&#x2019;d left it, no matter how hard we tried to pretend we could refurbish a ghost town. But the sun stuck around a little longer. The music returned. It wasn&#x2019;t miraculous, but we found our footing again.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Granted, long-term memory and I aren&#x2019;t on the best of terms, but it&#x2019;s impossible to locate a few favorite senior year memories. It didn&#x2019;t feel like that&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;moments of sorrow, then moments of elation. It felt like ballooning into new spaces between all those words that used to classify then, now, later.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used to think that anything good had to be tumultuous. I wanted art to arrest me, and I wanted to feel <em>everything. <\/em>Senior year was supposed to pack all the punch of a swig of Italian liquor. Perhaps to spite me, it instead took notes from &#x201C;Solar Power,&#x201D; which I&#x2019;m now growing to love.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had spent so long curating chaos in my life to accommodate my obsessive need for melodrama, but as it turns out, resisting getting older gets old.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#x2019;s actually quite beautiful to realize that adolescent turbulence is not a prerequisite for feeling alive. You don&#x2019;t have to be fundamentally altered by something for it to be good for you. You don&#x2019;t have to seek catharsis in every sunset. You don&#x2019;t have to milk every second for what it&#x2019;s worth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#x2019;ve never claimed to be wise, and I certainly won&#x2019;t do so now. But if there&#x2019;s anything I wish I would&#x2019;ve understood sooner, it was that my life doesn&#x2019;t have to have a perpetual coming-of-age-film ethos to mean something. I&#x2019;m going to be &#x201C;becoming&#x201D; forever, long past the expiration dates the entertainment industry loves setting for women, and long past the lingering sense of loss I still feel now. I&#x2019;m going to experience as much stillness as I will tumultuousness, and both will matter.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I sat &#x2014; pen and pad in hand and seat heater on &#x2014; at my first San Francisco movie premiere freshman year, I remember thinking how surreal it was to be a student journalist. As I wobbled in a rickety swivel chair at the Daily building typing and retyping print headlines years later, I remember thinking the same thing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just because a moment isn&#x2019;t glamorous doesn&#x2019;t mean it won&#x2019;t glisten, and when I shuffle through my memories of this place, I see a luminous haze.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Malia Mendez reflects on her time at Stanford. &#8220;It\u2019s actually quite beautiful to realize that adolescent turbulence is not a prerequisite for feeling alive.
