Based on this feedback, next year, they will be rolling out a brand new housing system that simultaneously addresses the inefficiencies of the current system and solves one of the most pressing problems plaguing Stanford students of all class years &#x2014; the Stanford dating scene.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike this quarter, where students are assigned a time slot to select their residence and room assignment, next year, students will instead return to ranking their housing preferences within their neighborhoods. In addition, students will now also be required to rank classmates they find attractive.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;We found that students rarely have spare time to devote to finding a significant other because of their already time-intensive commitments to academics, extracurriculars, friends, and sleep, so we wanted to implement a system that would make finding a partner as convenient as possible. When assigning housing, the system will consider both the housing rankings and the classmate rankings and attempt to put classmates who find each other attractive in the same residence to give students more opportunities during their busy schedules to find a partner during the academic year,&#8221; and R&amp;DE representative said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To facilitate this new focus on the dating scene at Stanford, R&amp;DE will also be rolling out a stipend program for students to take each other out on dates off campus, instead of at dining halls. The application-based program will be called &#x201C;SINGL,&#x201D; which stands for &#x201C;Stipend Intended for Not Getting Lonely.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;The new housing assignment system and SINGL are just some of the many innovative new systems and programs we plan on pioneering next year. We are also currently working on an initiative that will address students&#x2019; desires to save money by cooking for themselves,&#8221; an R&amp;DE financial representative explained. &#8220;We have received many emails about allowing students to have stoves in EVGR-A residences, for example, so we&#x2019;ve decided to open up a brand-new stove hub right next to EVGR-A. Students will be able to rent a stove by the hour at the hub, at the low price of just $89.99 per hour!&#x201D; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>R&amp;DE is excited to launch these various programs in the upcoming school year, and the University hopes that these feedback-based changes will help enrich students&#x2019; lives and help them to thrive in all aspects of their lives at Stanford.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article is purely satirical and fictitious.

Congratulations!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#x2019;s one problem: you procrastinated on finding summer housing, and now, there seem to be no more suitable, cheap housing options in the New York\/San Francisco\/Los Angeles\/Seattle\/Boston area. Well, have no fear! Here are some helpful hacks to find the perfect place at the perfect price:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Sell some of your non-essential organs to increase your buying power: <\/strong>There are so many organs that the human body doesn&#x2019;t need. By keeping these organs, you&#x2019;re wasting valuable money that could go towards your summer housing! You can start off small &#x2014; the spleen is important to the immune system, but don&#x2019;t let that piece of information sway you from selling it.

Just follow someone home, hijack their car, and you have yourself a shiny new crib for the summer!<\/li><li><strong>Live in a tech giant&#x2019;s guest house without them noticing: <\/strong>This one is simple. Pretend to be a gardener, and then sneak through a window to one of Elon Musk&#x2019;s guest houses. He won&#x2019;t even notice that one of the 28 rooms in his mansion has a stranger in it. If this doesn&#x2019;t work, try Mark Zuckerberg&#x2019;s five-house estate in Palo Alto.<\/li><li><strong>Don&#x2019;t sleep: <\/strong>Since you will mainly use your summer house for sleeping, a simple solution to not having summer housing is to not sleep!

of Madness\u2019 review: A powerful allegory of the time I smoked weed before watching \u2018Doctor Strange\u2019"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>When I finished watching &#x201C;Multiverse of Madness,&#x201D; I was very confused about what it wanted me to take away. Was it a commentary on the COVID-19 pandemic? A commentary on political polarization? Or was it a commentary on half-delirious journalists hastily connecting the film to broader social events? But after some careful analysis, I&#x2019;ve realized that &#x201C;Multiverse of Madness&#x201D; is a clear allegory to the time I smoked weed before watching &#x201C;Doctor Strange&#x201D; back in 2016. For any Marvel fans who somehow haven&#x2019;t seen &#x201C;Multiverse of Madness&#x201D; yet, expect to meditate thoughtfully with director Sam Raimi on the time I smoked weed before watching &#x201C;Doctor Strange,&#x201D; as well as the dangers of doing it again before watching &#x201C;Multiverse of Madness.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I arrived at the theater, I was about an hour late for the movie, and about three weeks late for when my &#x201C;Multiverse of Madness&#x201D; review was supposed to be published. This was clearly a metaphor of the time in 2016 when I was supposed to review &#x201C;Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip&#x201D; for Nickelodeon.com but accidentally downed a shit ton of edibles and entered the &#x201C;Doctor Strange&#x201D;<em> <\/em>theater instead. &#x201C;Multiverse of Madness&#x201D; has a sadistic pleasure in confusing its viewers. This helps suspend their disbelief that they were as confused as me in 2016, who didn&#x2019;t realize that I wasn&#x2019;t watching a bunch of CGI chipmunks until the end credits. Bravo Sam Raimi!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In times of unprecedented changes, &#x201C;Multiverse of Madness&#x201D; allows viewers to relive the good old days when they didn&#x2019;t have to worry about losing their job at Nickelodeon for &#x201C;reckless cannabis use&#x201D; and &#x201C;child endangerment.&#x201D; But it also warns viewers not to view the past with such uncritical nostalgia. Whoever designed the theater for &#x201C;Multiverse of Madness&#x201D; perfectly recreated the kid who would not stop playing &#x201C;Subway Surfers&#x201D; at full volume while I was trying to watch &#x201C;Doctor Strange.&#x201D; But &#x201C;Multiverse of Madness&#x201D; takes some artistic risks: instead of the kid playing &#x201C;Subway Surfers&#x201D; throughout the whole movie, it was me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, some fans may accuse &#x201C;Multiverse of Madness&#x201D; of pandering. Early in the second act, if a viewer briefly pauses their &#x201C;Subway Surfers&#x201D; game to pay attention to the movie, they will hear Benedict Cumberbatch say something about dreams. Cumberbatch is clearly trying to pander to the viewer&#x2019;s daily dreams of Cumberbatch throughout high school: imagining his PG-13 body against theirs, promising to give the viewer whatever fanservice they desire. Needless to say, this is one of the worst performances by Cumberbatch, and a blatant attempt to pander to the demographic of lonely high schoolers who would hide in the bathroom every lunch period to watch &#x201C;Sherlock. <em>How do you do, fellow kids?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But only my interpretation of &#x201C;Multiverse of Madness&#x201D; is valid, and anyone who disagrees is lying to me. For this reason I have to give &#x201C;Multiverse of Madness&#x201D; five Spongebobs out of five, which is the exact score I gave for &#x201C;Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip&#x201D; before my wife left me. See my other reviews for &#x201C;Spider-Man: No Way Home&#x201D; and &#x201C;Hawkeye,&#x201D; where I complain anytime an MCU movie does not perfectly recreate the time I watched &#x201C;Doctor Strange&#x201D;<em> <\/em>in 2016, which was honestly the last time I actually enjoyed a Marvel movie.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article is purely satirical and fictitious.

Y2K trends: iPods, low-rise jeans and homeownership"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s out with the old, in with the new&#x201D; &#x2014; as Sharpay Evans so aptly sang in the 2007 film High School Musical 2, the times are changing. Earlier this month, Apple officially discontinued the iPod, a miniature portable music player, after 20 years of its celebrated existence as an emblem of the Y2K era. As netizens mourn this tragic news, let&#x2019;s take a trip down memory lane and rate some of the most iconic Y2K trends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Low-Rise Jeans<br><\/em>One of the most controversial trends on this list, low-rise jeans have their fair share of fans and detractors. These jeans, however, are incredibly versatile. With the low cut enabling tiny, if nonexistent, pockets, you can snugly fit your iPod Nano in the crease of your hip. Better yet: layer your jeans with a dress for a powerful statement that screams fashionable indecision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>In-Person Bullying<br><\/em>Social media can be quite a monster, especially for younger users. Today&#x2019;s youth are either victimized by rumors on gigantic online group chats or sent hateful private messages via anonymous fake accounts. Remember the days when everything was IRL? Sure, that one kid from my math class kept insulting my Sketchers shoes, but at least I could argue back with him face-to-face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Britney Spears Songs<br><\/em>With global warming and pollution boosting the growth of harmful algal blooms in our oceans, Britney&#x2019;s hit song Toxic from 2003 really nailed it, even two decades later. In fact, climate change may lead to a <a href=\"https:\/\/agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/2015GL066235\">20% increase<\/a> in toxic algal blooms in the next century. With iconic bops that remain relevant so many years later, Britney&#x2019;s music is definitely a winner on this list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tweezing your Eyebrows<br><\/em>As a thick-eyebrowed person, I am more than happy to let this trend retire. Although patches of redness and ingrown hairs resulting from over-tweezing can perhaps carry their own messages as purposeful vessels of fashion, our foreheads are surely grateful for the well-deserved rest (and we can all aspire to be Cara Delevigne).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Homeownership<\/em><br>Before the 2008 recession, home ownership was on the rise. Subprime mortgage offers had everyone gaping at the Tuscan kitchens on HGTV and searching for the best neon inflatable couches for their dens. Of course, since then, homeownership rates have fallen such that today&#x2019;s millennials are less likely to own a home than their parents were at their age. Will this declining trend make a comeback later? Only time will tell&#x2026;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>iPods<\/em><br>The namesake of this list and the ultimate Y2K trend, it is with a heavy heart that we acknowledge its culmination. The iPods&#x2019; portable size and range of colors truly comprised the cutting edge of technology. If you miss feeling like the main character of your own Y2K era chick-flick, blasting Imma Be and Cry Me a River through these bad boys, then you may still be in luck. According to Apple&#x2019;s newsroom, the iPod touch will still be available &#x201C;while supplies last.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article is purely satirical and fictitious.

Makings of a Tech-Bro: Inside Stanford\u2019s new Elon Musk Center for Male Studies"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Before Elon Musk donated $3 billion to create the new Male Studies department, computer science was a male-dominated industry. Thousands of males languished away in their cushy programming jobs, girdling their testosterone supplies with each twist on their corporate-sponsored yoga balls. But now, the faculty of Male and Caucasian Studies (MCS) promises to remasculate the world, by teaching the next generation of tech-bros how to become true tech-men.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I decided to take an inside look at Stanford&#x2019;s new Male Studies department, and the wave of thinkers spearheading it. I first spoke to JASON! (stylized in all caps) Friedman, the 19-year-old chair of the department.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Male Studies is the <em>new <\/em>Computer Science,&#x201D; JASON! said. &#x201C;In just four years we offer our customers the next steps to kickstart their visionary potential to awaken the free man within them.&#x201D; As JASON! was struggling to pronounce the sentence, I felt something stir deep within my brain, having long been suppressed by Stanford&#x2019;s liberal indoctrination, now set aflame.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s your inner man,&#x201D; JASON! explained. &#x201C;But also the radiation from my Musk-sponsored Neuralink. If you want one, I can sign you up for an MCS writing class for just 50 GME stocks.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was 10 minutes late to my first class of &#x201C;Intro to Man Sounds: Finding Your Howl&#x201D; (MCS numbers all its classes as &#x201C;69,&#x201D; making classrooms difficult to find). MCS offers an exciting way of teaching communication: Neuralinks implant a copy of Elon Musk&#x2019;s mind within students&#x2019; brains, letting them think like the great billionaire. With all of Musk&#x2019;s catchphrases pre-installed, MCS classes instead focus on managing the side-effects of having Musk&#x2019;s mind, such as nighttime urges to drop out of Stanford.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I arrived at class, I saw 16 MCS majors sprawled on the floor with their limbs intertwined, quietly groaning as rainforest sounds played from a speaker nearby. Later, I would learn that these men were simply enacting &#x201C;punishment knots,&#x201D; a medical practice as mandated by MCS&#x2019;s Honor Code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Bodily contortion is the <em>new<\/em> G-fuel,&#x201D; Blake Campbell, a student of the class, would explain to me afterwards. &#x201C;Anytime we speak to an alpha, we have to stretch our bodies in such a way to quickly regenerate depleted testosterone. It&#x2019;s the cost of networking.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, of course, I was ignorant of this, and, upon smelling my presence, the men retreated into their &#x201C;alert&#x201D; pose &#x2014; a 170-degree man-spread. To avoid triggering any dominance conflicts, I followed the protocol JASON! had taught me: tell them my name, sperm count and all the internships I have. The men happily ushered me into the classroom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was hard to hear over the rainforest sounds, so the men graciously turned on a speaker blasting to their ambient music: Eminem. The teacher, who is randomly selected each week from a Discord poll, began to speak.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Today&#x2019;s class is the <em>new <\/em>yesterday&#x2019;s class,&#x201D; the teacher began. &#x201C;Yesterday we unlocked our potential by raising this class&#x2019;s unit load from 18 to 19. Who wants to see it go to 20?&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the students roared with glee, an orchestra of raw masculinity. But before the teacher could speak, our Neuralinks fired a ringing noise in our brains, notifying us that the MCS department had gone bankrupt. Apparently, some spiteful CS majors had shorted Bitcoin, rendering the department&#x2019;s budget essentially moot. Before sucking the remaining power from my brain, my Neuralink spared me a final thought: Would you like your diploma in matte black or electric blue?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article is purely satirical and fictitious.

System<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear students,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we enter the final stretch of the quarter, I hope you all have been taking good care of your mental health, using strategies such as praying to the Honor Code, pursuing pre-med or smiling more. This last week, however, one student decided to express his mental torment by compromising the academic integrity of his community. By sharing this student&#x2019;s story, I hope that all of you remember your duty to Stanford&#x2019;s Honor Code preceding this finals week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>[Content warning: academic plagiarism]<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jason Levin, Class of 2023 &#x2014; from here on referred to as <em>the Plagiarizer<\/em> &#x2014; was a misunderstood student hoping to complete his B.S. in Mathematics by next year. However, <em>the Plagiarizer<\/em>&#x2019;s schemes were thwarted when a TA discovered something peculiar about his recent problem set.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I was about to give Jason [<em>the Plagiarizer<\/em>] an A,&#x201D; wrote the TA in a formal complaint, &#x201C;When I noticed some weird symbols in his matrices. Weird because they made sense. What are these &#x2018;numbers&#x2019; doing in his math proof? Where is his citation?&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we all know, &#x201C;numbers&#x201D; are a rogue system invented by the Soviets in 1978 as a means of overthrowing the U.S.-controlled Nicaraguan government. The Hoover Institute had successfully eradicated any record of &#x201C;numbers&#x201D; in the second and third world; now, numbers enjoy a meek afterlife in countercultural circles and humanities friend groups. We hope that all students know that any use of &#x201C;numbers&#x201D; in a p-set requires a citation referencing their wretched history, as well as an actual, legal citation expressing consent to government surveillance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our troops (we thank our student-athletes) have had a long day at work locating <em>the Plagiarizer<\/em>, who was nowhere to be seen in his 30 units of classes. Luckily, thanks to the blood oath every student gives to the Honor Code, we were able to replicate his DNA and hold the rights to his future children hostage (we thank HBO&#x2019;s <em>Watchmen<\/em>). Only a few hours later, <em>the Plagiarizer<\/em> revealed his location.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have hereby stripped <em>the Plagiarizer<\/em> of his internships at Tesla and Google. Our Human Biology faculty chairs have also decided to neuter him so that his bloodline may never stain Stanford&#x2019;s image ever again. (Of course we could simply reject his children, but wouldn&#8217;t it be <em>so <\/em>awkward if your dad got into Stanford and you didn&#8217;t? We wouldn&#x2019;t do something so inhumane.) Today, you may see <em>the Plagiarizer<\/em> in his new debasing state, as a forced recruit of the Religious Studies department.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when we punish one, we punish all. Everyone must grieve the havoc that <em>the Plagiarizer<\/em> has wreaked on the community. So far, several students and faculty have expressed shock about the recent events.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>[Content warning: math]<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Well shit, there goes my networking opportunity,&#x201D; said Joshua Bowers, <em>the Plagiarizer<\/em>&#x2019;s former mentor.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;\\begin{document}\\[\\textrm{$%&#x3B1;N<em>x<\/em>!&#x3A3;&#x90FD;:)^!}\\]\\end{document},&#x201D; bemoaned a classmate, sending his comment via LaTeX.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We could not ask any other math students for comments, after learning from outside sources that &#x201C;talking to other people,&#x201D; &#8220;writing legibly&#8221; and &#8220;being comprehensible&#8221; are cultural no-nos in the Mathematics Department. To do otherwise would risk sabotaging its carefully manufactured image of being understood by nobody, and thereby &#x201C;genius.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we demand all of you to stay focused on your studies. Plagiarism is indeed a wretched thing: what would have happened if God plagiarized to make man? We hope that each day you reject the seductive vices of plagiarism, and return to the warm embrace of the glorious Honor Code. When you wake up each morning, I want you to ask yourself these questions: <em>Am I being academically honest with myself? How do I spread my academic truth to the people around me?<\/em> Because, again, academic integrity is the best thing any human being can hope to pursue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, 500 students died of COVID this week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happy hot girl summer!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matthias Fishburn<br>Vice President Provost-Chancellor for Undergraduate Education<br>Faculty Head of the Elon Musk Center of Male Studies<br>Aspiring Intern at Amazon<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article is purely satirical and fictitious.

Following his debut&#x2019;s breakout success at raves nationwide, his popularity continued to soar with &#x201C;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening&#x201D; in 1923, an upbeat and exuberant iambic-tetrameter take on strolling leisurely through the woods.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert Frost will be joined by Walt Whitman and Edgar Allan Poe.

said research director Lorrie Haynes. &#x201C;The setting works by calculating the prestigiousness of other people&#x2019;s job titles, companies and schools &#x2014; objective measurements for comparing their worth to yours. For instance, if you went to Stanford, you receive +3 points. If you went to Berkeley, -400 points. Profiles superior to yours get automatically blocked from your feed, so you feel better about your middling achievements in comparison.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haynes shared that this setting will block Forbes 30 Under 30 scholars, Harvard-educated lawyers-turned-CEOs-turned-thought-leaders and dogs who interned at Google, unless you happen to be better than them, which you aren&#x2019;t. She added, &#x201C;You can easily turn off the setting if you&#8217;re tired of your LinkedIn feed being completely empty.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;We are beyond grateful and thrilled to announce this new setting,&#x201D; said spokesperson Winnie Robertson at the launch event. She added that LinkedIn will next develop a chatbot that psychologically manipulates passionate, motivated people to stop following their dreams.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><em>Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article is purely satirical and fictitious.
