The felony of sexual battery, which Giacomini pleaded guilty to earlier this year, took place at the Veterans Affairs (VA) Hospital in Palo Alto. Several former colleagues from Stanford and the Palo Alto VA advocated for Giacomini&#x2019;s character in letters of support to the court, prior to his sentencing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giacomini led the cardiology department of the Palo Alto VA from 1985 to 2018. He also directed the Stanford Cardiology Fellowship and served as a Stanford Medicine faculty member. He <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/05\/15\/former-stanford-medicine-faculty-member-indicted-for-alleged-sexual-battery-at-palo-alto-va\/\">lost<\/a> those positions in 2018 when the accusations of sexual violence emerged. Stanford Medicine placed Giacomini on leave in June 2018 when they learned of the complaint, wrote Julie Greicius, a Stanford Healthcare spokesperson, in a statement to The Daily. Giacomini &#x201C;permanently left Stanford shortly thereafter, when the investigation resulted in grounds to terminate his contract,&#x201D; Greicius wrote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The case was referred to the U.S. Attorney&#x2019;s Office by the Department of Veterans Affairs because it occurred on federal property at the Palo Alto VA. Giacomini was <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/05\/15\/former-stanford-medicine-faculty-member-indicted-for-alleged-sexual-battery-at-palo-alto-va\/\">indicted<\/a> in 2020 by a federal grand jury and later pleaded guilty in March of this year, three days before his trial was set to begin. On Tuesday, Judge Freeman sentenced Giacomini to pay a fine of $15,000, undergo a special assessment and serve one year of supervised release in addition to his prison term.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The victim <a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/usao-ndca\/pr\/former-chief-cardiology-palo-alto-va-hospital-sentenced-prison-sexual-battery\">told<\/a> the court that &#x201C;the primary reason I reported these events was to help prevent this from happening to anyone else again, especially women fellows in the field of cardiology,&#x201D; during the sentencing. Giacomini began his unsolicited sexual contact with one of the victims in the fall of 2017. They resigned at the end of that year, following multiple instances of sexual harassment and abuse.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His attorney requested a more lenient sentence &#x2014; home confinement instead of prison &#x2014; in light of the letters of support and Giacomini&#x2019;s age and health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paul Yock, a current Stanford Medicine faculty member and the founding director of the Byers Center for Biodesign, wrote in a letter of support that he did &#x201C;not have any direct knowledge of the issues leading to [Giacomini&#8217;s] recent legal issues.&#x201D;&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yock concluded the letter by emphasizing his personal and professional admiration of Giacomini and respect for &#x201C;his deep commitment both to his clinical practice and to the training of young physicians and scientists.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x200B;&#x200B;Current Stanford Medicine faculty members Todd J. Brinton and Thomas Rando, as well as former faculty members Maurice Buchbinder and Michael Pham, submitted letters in support of Giacomini. Connor O&#x2019;Brien, Laura Dodera, William L. Bennett,&#xA0;Judy Baer, Tanta Blodget, Cheryl Leppi and Svetlana Gorbunova were also among the former colleagues who submitted letters in support of Giacomini.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony Brass, Giacomini&#x2019;s attorney, said he was &#x201C;grateful for the letters,&#8221; adding that &#x201C;the letters were speaking to the human side of the doctor, but were not on the subject of guilt and innocence as he had already accepted full responsibility.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The prosecutors wrote in their sentencing memorandum, a partially-redacted copy of which was obtained by The Daily, that &#x201C;sexual abuse is a crime of power. Abusers use their power to intimidate, molest, and silence the victim &#x2014; usually in that order.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The memo cites a witness &#x201C;who believed that Dr. Giacomini and his supporters retaliated against her professionally after she rebuffed his attempts to pursue a romantic relationship with her.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Referencing the letters of support, the prosecutors wrote that &#x201C;a cursory review of Dr. Giacomini&#x2019;s many letters of support conveys his power and prestige within the profession.&#x201D; According to the prosecutors, &#x201C;this power differential between Dr. Giacomini and Victim was an extremely aggravating factor severely undermining any pretense of her consent to his sexual advances.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The letters from his colleagues do not explicitly discuss an appropriate sentence but emphasize their positive view of his character and professional accomplishments.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stanford law professor and survivor advocate Michele Dauber wrote that &#x201C;it is disturbing and shocking to realize that the victim has read these letters and knows that her fellow physicians stood with the abuser and not with her,&#x201D; in a statement to The Daily. &#x201C;His conviction for his crimes directly contradicts any notion that he was a good mentor,&#x201D; she wrote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dauber wrote that Giacomini&#x2019;s conviction was indicative of widespread issues at the university, pointing to the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/06\/10\/destroyed-my-career-faculty-report-unchecked-sexual-harassment-in-school-of-medicine\/\">series<\/a> of allegations made by female faculty at the Stanford School of Medicine regarding &#x201C;unchecked sexual harassment.&#x201D; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stanford Medicine has zero tolerance for sexual harassment, Greicius added, and there are &#x201C;robust policies in place to address these matters.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;If any of our faculty, staff or students is experiencing or has experienced harassment or discrimination in our community, we want to hear from them,&#x201D; Greicius wrote.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article has been updated to include comment from Stanford Medicine.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A previous version of this story inaccurately attributed a quote to Michele Dauber. That quote has been removed. The Daily regrets this error.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Despite considerable support from former colleagues, former Stanford faculty member John Giacomini was

Levine, Assistant Secretary for Health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to reflect on her experiences combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Levine was nominated by the Biden Administration in February, 2021 and was <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/03\/24\/us\/politics\/rachel-levine-transgender-senate.html\"><em>confirmed<\/em><\/a><em> in March. During this year&#x2019;s Pride Month, Levine &#x2014; the first openly transgender official confirmed by the Senate &#x2014; <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DFRKDT3Px_E&amp;t=2938s\"><em>spoke<\/em><\/a><em> to the Stanford Department of Pediatrics about the pediatric disparities and unequal opportunities that LGBTQ+ youth face. On June 11, she also attended the 35th anniversary display of the AIDS Memorial Quilt at San Francisco&#x2019;s Golden Gate Park, recounting the deaths inflicted by the AIDS\/HIV epidemic that she witnessed firsthand as a pediatrician in 1983.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Stanford Daily [TSD]: What are some lessons that you learned from handling the COVID-19 pandemic?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rachel L. Levine [RL]:<\/strong>&nbsp; I think that there are some clear lessons. One of them is that we are truly all interconnected. Literally, the decisions that each one of us make about our health, whether that&#8217;s to get tested or to get vaccinated, impact not only ourselves, but they impact our communities, our families. They impact our nation and they literally impact the world. We are all truly interconnected in so many ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another lesson of the pandemic is the importance of public health. And public health sometimes gets lost in the general medical structure that we have in our medical health systems. But public health at the local, state, federal and international level is really critical for the health of our world and our nation and critical to our response to this pandemic. I used to say that cities like San Francisco were the center of the universe, but actually public health is the center of our universe. It&#8217;s that important.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TSD: What is the importance of community-based organizations to expand health access to minority groups?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RL:<\/strong> Health equity is so critical to our work in public health. And of course, I&#8217;m at the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), where our secretary Xavier Becerra&#x2019;s priority is that we embed health equity into all of our different work. Health equity has to be the foundation. We can work on that federally, but actually, I think that some of the most important work is community work. I&#8217;ll come and visit your community, but I&#8217;m not there day by day.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, community health workers, advocates and health and medical workers really are the frontlines on how we bring health equity to many vulnerable, marginalized populations. That, of course, includes the African American community, the Latino community, the American Indian Native Alaskan community, the AAPI (Asian American Pacific Islander) community and our LGBTQI+ community &#x2014; there are so many intersections among those communities. So we really appreciate and depend on community health workers, community organizers and stakeholders to do that work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2847\" height=\"2139\" src=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Image-from-iOS-1-1.jpg?w=800\" alt=\"Levine gives a speech from a stage.

Long COVID is going to be one of the medical challenges of our future&nbsp;&#x2014; our present and our future. The president recognizes that, and he has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefing-room\/presidential-actions\/2022\/04\/05\/memorandum-on-addressing-the-long-term-effects-of-covid-19\/\">issued<\/a> a presidential memorandum asking for two reports, one on the supports and services for patients who have long COVID and the other the National Research Action Plan on Long COVID. My office is coordinating the writing of those reports. We are the lead. I want to acknowledge so many people across the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and across the administration that are contributing to that report. We need to involve the entire medical community and our primary care doctors in that long COVID work. And then we need to work on the research agenda which is being led by NIH and CDC, such as the <a href=\"https:\/\/recovercovid.org\">RECOVER<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.covidinspire.org\">INSPIRE<\/a> grants, and across the HHS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to acknowledge specifically the work from the VA and the Department of Defense, both on their research as well as their works in terms of supports and services. And we&#8217;re going to develop that action plan. Now, the reports are the beginning: we don&#8217;t write the report and go to bed. That is the roadmap to these living documents and this living plan about how we&#8217;re going to help people with long COVID. I think you need to take the lessons learned from the HIV epidemic and from COVID-19 itself. We will also develop these programs by taking the lessons we&#8217;ve learned dealing with chronic illnesses like ME\/CFS (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis\/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) and Lyme disease. So that is going to be one of the things that I&#8217;m going to concentrate on during my time at HHS.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In an interview with The Stanford Daily,

She says she&#8217;s still waiting for justice."},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p><em>This story contains references to sexual misconduct and assault that may be troubling to some readers. The student&#8217;s name has been changed out of respect for her privacy.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first time it happened, they had been dating for four months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;He stuck himself inside of me and raped me,&#x201D; she remembered, pausing to find the right words to recount the painful experience. &#x201C;I cried for the entire night. We had a big discussion about it, which boiled down to, &#x2018;What you did wasn&#x2019;t okay. You knew that I didn&#x2019;t ever want to do this; why did you?&#x2019;&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura told The Daily<strong> <\/strong>that her ex-boyfriend raped her several times over the course of eight months. She had made it clear to him before that she wanted to wait to have sex, and in a conversation after the first time, she reiterated that she did not want to have sex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there was a second time &#x2014; after one of his fraternity&#x2019;s special dinners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost immediately, Laura added, &#x201C;He drank a little bit, and I drank a little bit, but we weren&#8217;t drunk at all.&#x201D; Her remark preempted the type of <a href=\"https:\/\/jacksonhealth.org\/support-sexual-assault-victims-stop-victim-blaming\/\">questioning<\/a> people who have experienced sexual violence can face when coming forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They had another discussion after he raped her again, and this time, he cried. He cried because, as she put it, &#x201C;he raped me, and he knew it.&#x201D; She then had to spend the night comforting her assaulter, she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Laura wasn&#x2019;t in a position to break up with him. She knew her parents would pull her out of Stanford if they found out what had happened &#x2014; she said that at the time, she was at a vulnerable point in her Stanford career and was also living with her boyfriend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the second assault, she told him they could have sex &#x2014; but only if he wore a condom. Yet often, he refused to wear one. After another big argument about it, they stopped having sex altogether. About a month later, they ended their year-long relationship in January 2020. Soon, COVID-19 lockdown started, and Laura didn&#x2019;t have to see him at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Laura returned to campus for spring quarter 2021 in-person, she said she saw her assaulter everywhere.<strong> <\/strong>His presence distressed her, and she wanted him off campus &#x2014; not necessarily out of school, but away from campus spaces and away from her. In an effort to see that hope through, she would spend her next months navigating the ins and outs of Stanford&#x2019;s Title IX process &#x2014; only to find herself lost in a process in which she said she lacked agency, autonomy and knowledge of what was going on.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Seeking justice<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>About two weeks before the 2021-22 school year began, Laura reached out to the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2021\/10\/27\/stanfords-current-title-ix-policies-explained\/\">Stanford Title IX Office<\/a> and opened a case. In accordance with the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/20200814-Title-IX-Procedure.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">University&#x2019;s Title IX procedure<\/a>, she said that they presented her with two options: enter a formal process, or sign an informal resolution. The <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/08\/04\/stanfords-draft-title-ix-procedures-explained\/\">formal process<\/a> procedure involves an external group investigating the case to determine whether to proceed to a hearing, during which the evidence is reviewed. An informal resolution involves the parties engaging in mediation with the help of an outside party and coming together to reach a mutual agreement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura chose to go the route of an informal resolution. She said she viewed this process as providing &#x201C;an adequate environment for [her] to heal and grow&#x201D; while &#x201C;additionally [allowing] the respondent to avoid harsher consequences for his actions.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Oct. 7, both parties signed an informal resolution, which was provided to The Daily. The resolution required the respondent to move off-campus, barred him from coming to campus unless academically necessary, prohibited him from attending Stanford-affiliated events (both on and off campus) and required him to disaffiliate from his fraternity. The respondent remained enrolled at Stanford. Following the informal resolution, The Title IX Office closed Laura&#x2019;s case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Laura would soon find that the respondent seldom followed the requirements of the informal resolution.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fourteen days later, the respondent violated the resolution terms for the first time when he attended a Stanford Women&#8217;s Soccer game. Email correspondence obtained by The Daily indicates that Title IX Coordinator and Director of the Sexual Harassment\/Assault Response &amp; Education Office (SHARE) Stephen Chen confirmed the incident with Laura&#x2019;s mother, in whom Laura ultimately confided, over a month after the violation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of the violation, Laura reached out to Chen to express concern about the respondent&#x2019;s presence on campus, including by sharing that she had been informed that the respondent was still a member of his fraternity and living in its house, according to the emails. She expressed her confusion to Chen, explaining that the Title IX Office had informed her that the respondent had moved off campus the day before the game. In his response, Chen answered with an explanation of how the respondent&#x2019;s plans for getting off campus had fallen through: he now planned to move out the following Monday, five days after he was originally supposed to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I hope that helps explain his presence on campus beyond what we were told,&#x201D; Chen wrote in an email to Laura on Oct. 23.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura&#x2019;s difficulties navigating the Title IX process are backdropped by Stanford&#x2019;s nearly two-in-five sexual violence rate for undergraduate women over the course of their academic career and what many see as an already fragmented relationship between people who have experienced sexual violence and the University. The sexual violence rate was determined by a 2019 Association of American Universities <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/AAU-2019-Survey-Stanford-Report-Summary.pdf\" data-type=\"URL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">survey<\/a>, which also found that 56% of Stanford students believe that campus officials wouldn&#x2019;t conduct a fair investigation &#x2014; the percentage is 71% for undergraduate women and 81% for transgender, genderqueer, nonbinary or otherwise gender nonconforming (TGQN) members of the Stanford community. The survey also found that 52% of undergraduate women and 61% of TGQN members of the community believe that campus officials wouldn&#x2019;t take the report seriously.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the University declined to comment on Laura&#x2019;s case for confidentiality reasons, Student Affairs spokesperson Pat Harris wrote in a statement to The Daily that Stanford encourages those who have experienced sexual harassment to contact the Title IX Office.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Stanford&#x2019;s priority when contacted by a student with a Title IX concern is to assess any affected student&#x2019;s safety and well-being,&#x201D; Harris wrote. &#x201C;The University is dedicated to responding quickly, appropriately, in a caring manner and in accordance with the circumstances presented.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to confidential counseling through the <a href=\"https:\/\/vaden.stanford.edu\/confidential-support-team-cst\">Confidential Support Team<\/a> (CST) and<a href=\"https:\/\/yourywca.stanford.edu\/\"> YWCA at Stanford<\/a>, students may also receive academic accommodations and campus escort services, Harris wrote. She also mentioned the potential for mutual restrictions on contact between the parties, changes in work or housing locations, leaves of absence and increased security and monitoring of certain campus areas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for Laura, the University&#x2019;s institutional support was lacking: she turned to others for help, including the resident assistants (RAs) at the respondent&#x2019;s fraternity, as the respondent continued to violate the terms of the informal agreement by returning to campus, she said.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Correspondence between Laura and two RAs shows several discussions between the three in which they tried to identify avenues of support. While one RA said that a conversation with the Title IX Office clarified that they could not get involved with the case for privacy and legal reasons, the RAs expressed to Laura that they still wanted to support her however they could. Often, she would turn to the RAs to ask whether the respondent had been seen on campus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, one of the RAs, who spoke with The Daily on the condition of anonymity for fear of university retribution, said that in general, RAs are inadequately trained to address issues related to sexual assault. He said that while they have been directed to reach out to the Title IX Office in the event of an incident, communication between RAs and the Title IX Office has historically been sparse. He added that they often have to reach out to the Title IX Office multiple times to receive a response.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;There&#8217;s a disconnect between what the office sees is necessary when it comes to reaching out and what is actually necessary in practice; communication has not been strong with RAs around even closed cases,&#x201D; he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chen did not respond to a request for comment on communication between RAs and the Title IX Office.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Unenforced resolution<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout fall and winter quarter of the 2021-22 school year, Laura continued to receive reports from friends warning her that they had seen the respondent on campus, leaving her feeling unsafe. She navigated campus in fear of seeing the respondent; at one point, she asked RAs at the respondent&#x2019;s fraternity if she needed to avoid the fraternity house because of the possibility of encountering him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this time, enforcement of the informal resolution seemed to fall on Laura and her mother, who found themselves consistently notifying Chen of the reported violations. Correspondence between Laura&#x2019;s mother and Chen shows that Chen did not share any actions that the Title IX Office was planning to take. The suggestions he did provide to get the respondent off campus placed the burden on Laura and her mother. Chen said they could file a complaint about his presence on campus in violation of a university directive, but specified that it could &#8220;take months to resolve.&#8221; He added that they could also ask the Stanford Department of Public Safety to request that he be escorted off campus, but later said that they would &#x201C;need to get an official stay away order from [the] General Counsel&#x2019;s office before the police [would] actually remove [the respondent] from campus.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After he had verified the respondent&#x2019;s first violation, Chen wrote in an email to Laura&#x2019;s mom that &#x201C;it&#x2019;s also important to note that that was almost two months ago, and he&#x2019;s been on the East coast for most of the time since then.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first weekend of December, one of Laura&#x2019;s friends told Laura that they had seen the respondent at the Row house where his girlfriend lived. Chen explained that he had allowed the respondent to come back to campus for a non-academic reason to retrieve some of his belongings, a visit that would have been a violation of the informal resolution. However, he didn&#x2019;t inform Laura until after the respondent had already arrived on campus and said he couldn&#x2019;t explain the respondent&#x2019;s presence at another residence. Laura also didn&#x2019;t understand why Chen let the respondent back on campus in the first place: he could&#x2019;ve just as easily gotten somebody to get his belongings and bring them to him, she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Chen ultimately told Laura&#x2019;s mom that the Title IX Office could request a stay away order, he added that the order likely wouldn&#x2019;t be completed in the next few hours and by then, the respondent would have already left campus. He did not discuss the order&#x2019;s potential implications for future breaches.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Referring to this particular violation and Chen&#x2019;s response, Laura wrote, &#x201C;[Chen] didn&#8217;t care that the respondent was on campus and was (seemingly) mad that I was having friends tell me to stay away from certain areas so I didn&#8217;t run into my assaulter.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said she felt helpless every time she brought up a violation to the Title IX Office, only to be met with unclear answers that left her still wondering how the office was going to enforce the resolution. &#x201C;I [wanted the Title IX Office] to do more things to punish [the respondent] or basically incentivize him to stop coming to campus and stop breaking these terms that he signed,&#x201D; she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/20200814-Title-IX-Procedure.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stanford&#x2019;s Title IX Procedure<\/a> outlines the process of coming to an informal resolution, it does not include information on how such resolutions are enforced. Chen did not respond to The Daily&#x2019;s request for comment on the incident or on what pathways exist for complainants when a respondent violates the terms of an informal resolution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Law professor Michele Dauber, who declined to comment on a specific student matter, wrote in an email to The Daily that she has &#x201C;long had concerns about whether informal resolutions sufficiently protect survivors.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;In my view it is essential that Stanford&#8217;s processes are clear and transparent so that survivors know how an informal resolution will be enforced before they agree to it,&#x201D; Dauber wrote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dauber also stressed the importance of investigating alleged violations of informal resolutions and adjudicating them swiftly and in ways that &#x201C;protect the rights of survivors&#x201D;. She suggested that the University take measures such as &#x201C;ensuring that all decision makers are trauma informed, utilizing the preponderance of the evidence as the burden of proof and providing needed legal assistance and other supports and accommodations.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Midway through winter quarter, Laura said, the Title IX Office began the process of formally charging the respondent for violating the informal resolution. However, they informed her that her case was being passed to the Office of Community Standards (OCS), where it took a new form as a case regarding a breach of a <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/20200814-Title-IX-Procedure.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">university directive<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura explained that her frustration grew when her case got handed to OCS. &#x201C;Every single time that I would ask for updates, [the Title IX Office] would say we don&#8217;t know because we&#8217;re not a part of that office,&#x201D; she said, explaining that she was no longer the complainant in the case &#x2014; the Title IX Office was.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because she wasn&#x2019;t the complainant, Laura said that she couldn&#x2019;t submit evidence or control anything about the case. She feared that she wouldn&#x2019;t get the opportunity to advocate for herself.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked to clarify policies surrounding complainants in OCS cases, Harris wrote that &#x201C;others harmed by the alleged behavior can request to become a co-complainant in an OCS concern, thereby securing all the responsibilities and privileges of a complainant.&#x201D; She added that all parties are afforded rights in accordance with <a href=\"https:\/\/archive.ph\/K80u3\">Stanford&#x2019;s Student Judicial Charter of 1997<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an email to The Daily on behalf of Harris, Jennifer Calvert, Student Affairs Chief of Staff, explained that individuals or groups wishing to become co-complainants should make that request directly to OCS. However, this option is not specifically outlined in either the Student Judicial Charter or the <a href=\"https:\/\/communitystandards.stanford.edu\/\">OCS website<\/a> as of the date of publication.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An OCS process may involve one reporting party or multiple reporting parties. The party that files a concern with OCS is considered the Reporting Party. If another individual (or individuals) wishes to become a Reporting Party in the same incident of reported conduct, then they can make that request directly to OCS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The respondent was also slated to graduate in winter 2022, and the informal resolution terms were set to expire upon his graduation &#x2014; &#x201C;not that they really did anything,&#x201D; Laura said. Currently, Laura said, the respondent is not listed under Stanford&#8217;s student profiles, however it is unclear if that indicates he is no longer at the University.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The University did not clarify whether not having a student profile indicates that the respondent is no longer a student.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Finding safety<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As of now, Laura said she has not been informed of any result from the OCS case. In the meantime, she is seeking a permanent restraining order from the county, which can last between three and five years, citing inadequate protection from the University. Her trial is set for later this month. Until then, a temporary restraining order (TRO) that Laura got in late February (and extended in late March) will remain in place, requiring the respondent to stay off of the Stanford campus and at least 300 yards away from her at all times. Laura said that since the TRO went into effect during winter quarter, the respondent has stopped violating the informal resolution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I finally feel safe on campus,&#x201D; she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura will be representing herself in her trial for the permanent restraining order, as she did in February and March for the temporary order. The respondent, however, has retained a lawyer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Stanford provides <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/20200814-Title-IX-Procedure.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">legal resources<\/a> for Title IX procedures, Laura no longer has access to them because her Title IX case is closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harris wrote that the University&#x2019;s &#x201C;professional staff remain in close contact and accessible to students throughout the Title IX and any related processes, including any hearings and discussions regarding informal resolutions, and continue to offer supportive measures as needed.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In late March, Stanford Title IX attorney Susan Stark, who represented the respondent during the Title IX process, informed Chen of the respondent&#x2019;s intent to file a concern with OCS, saying that Laura&#x2019;s filing of a restraining order is a violation of the informal resolution, which states that &#x201C;both parties will not have any further contact with one another and agree not to pursue any further formal actions related to incidents arising from their past relationship.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In email correspondence reviewed by The Daily, Chen explained to Laura that the respondent would be willing to withdraw the OCS case if Laura stopped pursuing a restraining order and was open to modifying the informal resolution to apply even after he graduates. &#x201C;The practical effect would be similar to a restraining order,&#x201D; Chen wrote. He added that &#x201C;the respondent is taking the informal resolution more seriously, so there may be reason to believe that he would abide by the terms going forward,&#x201D; though he did not elaborate on any observed behavior that led to this belief.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura, however, decided to continue pursuing the restraining order.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In early April, Chen informed all parties involved over email that they would communicate directly with OCS going forward, instead of the Title IX Office. Since then, Laura hasn&#x2019;t heard anything about the OCS complaint, concluding that it is likely the respondent didn&#x2019;t pursue it. But, she said it was clear that he and Stark wanted to discourage her from pursuing the restraining order by threatening a complaint.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stark did not respond to The Daily&#x2019;s request for comment regarding her involvement in the case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>&#x2018;I should have just done the formal process&#x2019;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Had I known [all this would happen], I would have just gone through the formal process,&#x201D; Laura said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She chose to go with an informal resolution because she wanted to resolve the case quickly. But despite choosing the informal route, her process has already spanned over ten months. &#x201C;I should have just done the formal process. That might have gotten me a better outcome,&#x201D; she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Laura said that a recent conversation with Chen has given her the impression that the Title IX Office is looking into making changes to their informal resolution policies as a result of her case (Chen did not respond to The Daily&#x2019;s request for comment on such developments), Laura remains concerned that others seeking justice through the Title IX Office will have to go through a similar ordeal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She recommended that students who have experienced sexual violence reach out to the <a href=\"https:\/\/yourywca.stanford.edu\/\">YWCA<\/a> at Stanford, a program of YWCA Golden Gate Silicon Valley that <a href=\"https:\/\/yourywca.stanford.edu\/\">provides<\/a> &#x201C;confidential support to survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence, human trafficking, stalking, and sexual harassment.&#x201D; Lindsey Mansfield, the Director of Support Services at YWCA Golden Gate Silicon Valley, explained that the YWCA team connects with survivors to help them determine the best resources for their situation. &#x201C;Each resource or course of action we discuss is guided by what the individual wants to focus on,&#x201D; she wrote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those seeking legal recourse, Mansfield said the YWCA recommends the <a href=\"https:\/\/assu.stanford.edu\/services\/legal-counsel-office\">Associated Students of Stanford Legal Counsel Office<\/a>. For off-campus support, they often refer survivors to the Santa Clara County <a href=\"https:\/\/countyda.sccgov.org\/victim-services\/family-justice-centers\">Family Justice Centers<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scscourt.org\/self_help.shtml\">Self-Help Center<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For individuals who want to remain anonymous, the YWCA recommends the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rainn.org\/resources\">Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network<\/a> hotline numbers and online chatting, according to Mansfield.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another resource available to members of the Stanford community includes Sexual Assault Response Team (SART) <a href=\"https:\/\/archive.ph\/MbFvK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">testing<\/a>, which is available at Stanford Hospital.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I just hope that other survivors are more aware of the failings of the Title IX process and are able to make a better-informed decision,&#x201D; Laura said.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Months after a Stanford student brought her case of sexual misconduct to the Stanford Title IX office, her assaulter continued to violate the terms of their signed agreement, she said.

Decades. All that wealth &#x2014; and for what? Truly a waste. You have no excuse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the way, when I address &#x201C;Stanford&#x201D; here, I am addressing those in positions of power and authority. The more power you have, and the more you are being paid, the more accountable you are to your community and for Stanford&#x2019;s failures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: In 2000, you let your &#x201C;star&#x201D; faculty violate my 22-year-old self. That&#x2019;s how my career began &#x2014; with violence I am still struggling to comprehend. I was so naive and inexperienced I was confused by what was happening. I &#x2014;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: Now you&#x2019;re <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/19\/a-stanford-professor-sexually-harassed-his-student-a-decade-ago-some-female-students-say-his-inappropriate-behavior-never-stopped\/\">sending your rape culture to CUNY<\/a> where I work and teach? How dare you! How dare you invade my home?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: This letter is repetitive because traumatic re-living is repetitive and you continue to resurrect those hideous memories by making headlines about rape culture on your campus.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: My parents sacrificed a lot to give me a life less chaotic and violent than theirs. They trusted you to keep their daughter safe from the &#x201C;bad&#x201D; behavior of serial abusers. Their trust was betrayed  &#x2014; not once, not twice, but over and over and over and over and over again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: CUNY is underfunded. You are overfunded. What is the correct way to redress such inequality? I don&#x2019;t know. I do know that letting your rape culture make contact with CUNY students is the wrong way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: Colleagues were &#8220;repeatedly asked to &#x2018;babysit&#x2019; Barletta&#8221;? In what universe is such infantilization of a serial abuser acceptable?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: You cannot possibly claim that you are &#x201C;helpless&#x201D; here, that you &#x201C;had no idea,&#x201D; that you are understaffed or under-resourced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: When I was a 22-year-old first-year Ph.D. student in your English Department, your &#x201C;star&#x201D; faculty raped and harassed me. I was unable, under such circumstances, to excel, to collaborate with colleagues (he isolated me), unable at times to work (I was too busy trying to avoid being raped), often unable to think at all. And my abuser did this to others at Stanford too. Not only did my abuser harm multiple students, but you continue to allow <a href=\"https:\/\/academic-sexual-misconduct-database.org\/incidents?query=stanford\">multiple people in positions of power and authority to harm generations of students and employees<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: How could you. How could you <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/news\/2008\/march12\/oldbooks-031208.html\">name that library in his honor<\/a> after you yourself punished him for what he did to me? He used one of those <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/SAAASA\/permalink\/5687106724695954\">books<\/a> to &#x2014; I won&#x2019;t finish this sentence. I won&#x2019;t go there. Not again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: You have squandered my patience and goodwill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/pr\/92\/920602Arc2192.html\">Archuleta<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/19\/a-stanford-professor-sexually-harassed-his-student-a-decade-ago-some-female-students-say-his-inappropriate-behavior-never-stopped\/\">Barletta<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/stanfordpolitics.org\/2017\/12\/03\/jay-fliegelman-sexual-misconduct\/\">Fliegelman<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2017\/11\/16\/harassment-assault-allegations-against-moretti-span-three-campuses\/\">Moretti<\/a> &#x2014; why? Just &#x2014; why?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: This is not how I want to be spending my summer. I was actually working on my book project when news about Vincent Barletta &#x201C;mentoring&#x201D; CUNY students reset my brain&#x2019;s time zone to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/PTSD?src=hashtag_click\">#PTSD<\/a>. For the past month, I&#x2019;ve been re-living the year 2000 (when your &#x201C;star&#x201D; faculty violated my 22-year-old self).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: Fuck you for <a href=\"https:\/\/stanfordmag.org\/contents\/remembering-jay-fliegelman\">covering up<\/a> the abuse and the punishment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: You are Victor Frankenstein and my suffering is the creature you made. Take responsibility for your creation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: I had just turned 22 years old.&nbsp; I was naive and inexperienced. I was a first-year graduate student, new to the profession, new to teaching, new to California, new to Stanford. He was tenured. He was powerful. He was in his 50s. <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/pr\/2007\/pr-fliegelman-082207.html\">He had been a Stanford institution for decades<\/a>. This is disjointed because I&#8217;m reliving it all over again. Shortly after he violated me, I was hospitalized. Shortly after I was discharged from the hospital, I gave a <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn.kqed.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/10\/2017\/12\/Syllabus.jpg\">guest lecture on Seneca Falls and women&#x2019;s rights<\/a>. His response was to tell me I forgot to mention women&#8217;s right to sexual pleasure. There are gaps here because trauma is nonlinear, trauma broke my sense of time. At some point you conducted an investigation. As a <a href=\"https:\/\/academic-sexual-misconduct-database.org\/person\/jay-fliegelman\">result<\/a> of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.documentcloud.org\/documents\/4323656-Debra-Zumwalt-Letter-to-Seo-Young-Chu-11-27-2017.html\">the investigation<\/a>, which was a brutal experience, you punished my abuser by suspending him for two years without pay. Some of his colleagues had the gall to blame me for the whole debacle.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: By enabling rape culture and abuse to flourish, you promote hostile thinking environments. You poison ideas. You destroy minds. You weaken intellectual communities. You prevent work from happening.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: Every minute, hour, day, week, month, year, decade of your silence and inaction is disrupting my &#x201C;career,&#x201D; is relevant to my work, has shaped my sense of self as an academic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: I&#x2019;ve never sued you. I&#x2019;ve generously given you free feedback. I&#x2019;ve extended every deadline. I&#x2019;ve been more than patient with you. I&#x2019;ve spent countless hours <a href=\"https:\/\/asapjournal.com\/after-a-refuge-for-jae-in-doe-a-social-media-chronology\/\">educating you<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/asecsgradcaucus.wordpress.com\/2017\/11\/11\/asecs-executive-board-statement-on-harassment-and-abuse\/\">cleaning up your messes<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: By criticizing you I am not &#x201C;attacking&#x201D; your students, alumni, and workers. I am trying to make your campus better. Safer. More hospitable to learning. By speaking out like this I am trying to be a good alumna. I hope you are paying attention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: The truth is that my career started with rape. My career has been shaped by rape. My sense of who I am as an academic: shaped by rape. The gaps in my CV are trauma-generated plot holes that lead to Northern California in the year 2000.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: I&#x2019;m angry, I&#x2019;m disabled, I have work to do, I have a migraine. I want to lie down and shut my eyes and rest. But this is too important. I can&#x2019;t rest until CUNY is safe from your rape culture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: Have you even read &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/entropymag.org\/a-refuge-for-jae-in-doe-fugues-in-the-key-of-english-major\/\">A Refuge for Jae-in Doe<\/a>&#x201D;? The whole point of my sharing all that pain &#x2014; and in a language your English Department would understand: sonnets! The Western Canon! English (Major)! &#x2014; was to prevent more students from being harmed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: I am as &#x201C;proud&#x201D; to have a degree from your school as I would be &#x201C;proud&#x201D; to sport a blood diamond. Yes, the degree may glitter. But how much pain, injustice, conflict, humiliation, abuse, and violence does such glitter belie?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: I am ashamed to be associated with you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: If I were to write a book about your response to my requests for answers and answerability, most of the book&#x2019;s pages would be blank.

buildings on Stanford&#x2019;s main campus on Tuesday morning, according to an AlertSU notification. The source of the outage was <a href=\"https:\/\/emergency.stanford.edu\/\">identified<\/a> as a power line within the University&#x2019;s power infrastructure. The line provides power to the Green Library East Wing and the Coupa Cafe location adjacent to the library.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Power was <a href=\"https:\/\/police.stanford.edu\/alertsu.html?alertid=1343#top\">restored<\/a> in the afternoon to most other buildings affected, except Green Library East Wing and the Coupa Cafe, according to the latest update. Earlier in the day, 39 buildings were without power, four of which the University decided to temporarily close.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first Alert SU was issued at 6:54 a.m., notifying students of the partial outage. An update at 10:59 a.m stated that the outage was due to a malfunction within campus infrastructure, unlike the recent <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/24\/power-returns-to-campus-after-prolonged-outage\/\">PG&amp;E outage<\/a> in June when the Edgewood Park fire caused a PG&amp;E system failure and a two-day power outage across campus&#x200B;&#x200B;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buildings initially affected by the outage included the Knight Building, Arrillaga Alumni Center, Fire &amp; Police buildings, and Arrillaga Gym &amp; Weight Room, among others. No student residences lost power. The University provided a <a href=\"https:\/\/emergency.stanford.edu\/\">map<\/a> showing all of the locations affected by the outage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\"

Wing and adjacent cafe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>University spokesperson Luisa Rapport wrote that the cause of the outage is &#x201C;under investigation,&#x201D; in an email to The Daily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Any additional work or changes to the power system would depend on the cause of determination,&#x201D; Rapport wrote. &#x201C;Campus safety is a priority for university staff and is the first consideration, whether repairing, investigation or improving the power system.&#x201D;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A partial power outage led to the

the first time ever, I can relate to a superhero"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>I still remember how fun it was to watch the first Avengers film in theaters. Growing up immersed in the Marvel fandom, I found that the films never disappointed me &#x2014; the characters, scripts and cinematography were all simply brilliant. However, in spite of my love for Marvel, the characters often felt out of reach. The monsters, superheroes and action scenes all centered white American men in the United States, specifically in New York. I&#8217;m not complaining about the amusement &#x2014; I love NYC &#x2014; but why only there?<br><br>As a six-year-old turning the pages of colorful comics, I couldn&#x2019;t imagine scenarios in my head where I saved the Earth from evil without changing who I really was, because there was nobody like me on the Avengers team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marvel, like many Hollywood franchises, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.martlet.ca\/true-diversity-in-marvel-movies-is-lacking\/\">lacked<\/a> representation of marginalized communities for a long time. Much of Western media&#x2019;s depictions of Islam, especially after 9\/11, portrayed Muslims as either Middle Eastern terrorists who attack innocent people, narrow-minded men who control their families or women facing oppression under their own religion. These kinds of depictions in movies and television shows have fuelled a dangerous rise of <a href=\"https:\/\/news.gallup.com\/poll\/157082\/islamophobia-understanding-anti-muslim-sentiment-west.aspx\">Islamophobia<\/a> in the West.<br><br>Mistakenly, some people celebrate a scene as a groundbreaking example of representation when a non-white person comes on screen for not more than 5 minutes, says two or three lines and then never appears again. Representation needs to be more than that. We need to see characters that are played by actors who share their roots. We need films championing representation that have deeper storylines and showcase the characters&#x2019; cultures.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, Marvel has come a long way in &#x201C;Phase 4,&#x201D; or the films and shows covering the sequence of events after Avengers: Endgame. Its shows and movies now include depictions of diverse communities, <a href=\"https:\/\/movieweb.com\/moon-knight-representation-of-mental-illness\/\">mental illness<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/black-panther\/\">Black<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/arts-entertainment\/interactive\/2021\/shang-chi-asian-tropes\/\">Asian<\/a> culture and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chsglobe.com\/45290\/reviews\/lgbtq-representation-in-marvel\/\">LGBTQ+<\/a> individuals. And with Ms. Marvel, I finally saw myself reflected in a Marvel superhero.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Ms. Marvel&#x201D; is based on the 2014 solo comic book series by G. Willow Wilson and tells the story of Kamala Khan, also known as Ms. Marvel &#x2014; a 16-year-old Pakistani-American teenager from New Jersey with superpowers. Kamala, a comic book and Avengers nerd who struggles to fit in at both school and home, is Marvel&#x2019;s first-ever Muslim headliner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>19-year-old Canadian-Pakistani actress Iman Vellani is a perfect fit for the character. Hiring someone who actually shares the same roots as the character is very important for executing outstanding representation. Historically, in Hollywood, many Muslim and South-Asian characters have been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/entertainment\/movies\/la-et-mn-racial-erasure-essay-20160418-story.html\">played<\/a> by white people, which limits representation and makes it hard to embrace the authenticity of the characters. However, Marvel&#x2019;s casting of Vellani is one of the best portrayals so far.&nbsp; She brings both the colorful Muslim-South Asian side of her character and all the charm, passion, brilliance and awkwardness of a teenager to Kamala&#x2019;s character with ease. Considering that this is Vellani&#x2019;s first role ever on-screen, she does an amazing job and is sure to be a rising force in Hollywood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a Muslim teenager, &#x201C;Ms. Marvel&#x201D; means so much to me. Her superpowers grant her an air of strength, yet she is still a cheery, curious and nerdy teenager. She tries to navigate through life while having arguments with her parents, struggling to pay attention in school and trying to balance her social and religious commitments with her superhero dreams. In one scene that I particularly loved, Kamala schemes her way into attending AvengersCon with her friend against her parents&#x2019; wishes by jumping into the tree outside her window (and failing). However, she does not give up, and after all the obstacles that get in her way, she ends up getting to AvengersCon.&nbsp; Thereafter, she discovers her powers when she, without any hesitation, rescues one of her friends. She emanates a powerful image of a young superheroine who will be a great role model to many young girls from different communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marvel also succeeds in its depiction of Kamala&#x2019;s cultural roots, from the comedy of her friend&#x2019;s stolen shoes at the mosque to shopping for Pakistani clothes and reciting Muslim prayers. The show also touches on the implications of being a hijabi or a non-hijabi in the Muslim community in Episode 2, when Kamala talks to her close friend Nakia about her experience as a hijabi.<br><br>&#x201C;My whole life I&#x2019;ve either been too white for some people or too ethnic for others, and it&#x2019;s been this very uncomfortable, sucky in-between,&#x201D; said Nakia. &#x201C;When I first put [my hijab] on, I was hoping to shut some people up, but I kind of realized I don&#x2019;t need to prove anything to anybody. When I put this on, I feel like me &#x2014; like I have a purpose.&#x201D;<br><br>There are many <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/blog\/markaz\/2016\/01\/19\/the-right-to-choose-to-wear-or-not-hijab\/\">schools of thought<\/a> about the hijab in Islam, but Marvel showed both that the hijab can be a choice of a free-minded person and that a Muslim woman can still be a part of the religion even if she doesn&#x2019;t wear it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the show&#x2019;s soundtrack offers a platform for representation, featuring numerous Pakistani and Muslim songs and musicians such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nme.com\/en_asia\/news\/music\/pakistani-rapper-eva-bs-song-rozi-featured-in-ms-marvel-episode-i-am-feeling-so-lucky-3246997\">&#x201C;Rozi&#x201D;<\/a> by Eva B, &#x201C;Pasoori&#x201D; by Ali Sethi-Shae Gill and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bolnews.com\/entertainment\/2022\/06\/ms-marvel-features-pakistani-music\/\">many more<\/a>. Music might seem like a small detail in the series, but it makes the show even more relatable for the Muslim community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although I believe that &#x201C;Ms. Marvel&#x201D; is a major step forward for representation, there are still areas for improvement in the show. For example, Kamala&#x2019;s parents are portrayed as being more conservative, sometimes discouraging her from pursuing what she is passionate about. Perhaps this is just the classic television trope of parents being too strict with their children, but this depiction still felt somewhat stereotypical, and emphasized Western preconceptions that Islam is a restrictive and narrow-minded religion. While many Muslim women experience such conservatism in their households, it is important that the depiction of Muslim people in one of the world&#x2019;s biggest media franchises does not promote the misunderstanding that Islam is an inherently unequal religion. The fundamentals of Islam are equality, peace, respect and love.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only four episodes have been released thus far, but I hope the rest of the series will focus even more on the caring, supporting and accepting side of Islam, such as in the scene where Kamala&#8217;s parents promise that they will love Kamala no matter what and that she will never be alone. Seeing how far Marvel has come with its depictions of various communities, I remain optimistic.<br><br>&#x201C;Ms. Marvel&#x201D; is an iconic and game-changing series for Muslim representation in the MCU. Kamala Khan&#x2019;s character offers an opportunity for Muslim girls to relate to a powerful Muslim superheroine and serves as a role model who finds the motive and strength to break through the real-world challenges facing Muslim women today, from patriarchy to Islamophobia. There still remains much work to be done to improve representation in Hollywood for so many communities, but Ms. Marvel has given me hope and optimism that we will continue to see even more meaningful representation on the big screen.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a Muslim teenager, \u201cMs. Marvel\u201d means so much to

director of Stanford Hospital Epidemiology\/Infection Prevention and Control. &#x201C;It is safe, and this infection appears to be transmitted primarily through very close, intimate contact.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Current monkeypox infections present as painful rash-like blisters that appear across the body, particularly on the face, hands, chest and genitals, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/poxvirus\/monkeypox\/symptoms.html\">according<\/a> to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Other symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache and swollen lymph nodes. These symptoms commonly last 2-4 weeks until full skin recovery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stanley Deresinski, a clinical professor of infectious diseases, encouraged a calm and cautious approach to tackling the monkeypox community infection. The best way forward, he said, is through timely education about the development of the virus.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first known case of the 2022 U.S. outbreak occurred on May 18, when a U.S. citizen tested positive for monkeypox on arrival back to the United States after traveling to Canada. As of July 1, the U.S. has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/poxvirus\/monkeypox\/response\/2022\/us-map.html\">460<\/a> confirmed monkeypox cases, with 23 cases reported in the Bay Area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among U.S. states, California currently has the most cases of monkeypox with 95 confirmed cases, and New York follows close behind at 90, according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/poxvirus\/monkeypox\/response\/2022\/us-map.html\">July 1 CDC report.<\/a> Deresinski expects the number of cases in the state to continue to rise, especially during peak tourism months on the West Coast.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, the monkeypox outbreak has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/poxvirus\/monkeypox\/response\/2022\/index.html\">primarily<\/a> been seen in men who have sex with men. Given a long history of first-affected populations being scapegoated during disease outbreaks, Deresinski said he worries that the LGBTQ+ community may face heightened discrimination. Similar instances of prejudice were seen during the HIV\/AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, which was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hrc.org\/resources\/debunking-common-myths-about-hiv\">labeled<\/a> as a &#x201C;gay disease,&#x201D; and during the current COVID-19 pandemic, which has been referred to as the &#x201C;China virus&#x201D; or &#x201C;kung-flu,&#x201D; <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2021\/03\/18\/stanfords-asian-community-calls-for-allyship-in-wake-of-anti-asian-hate-crimes\/\">inciting<\/a> racist attacks against Asian Americans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Even though we have not yet verified that it&#8217;s officially sexually transmitted, we know it&#8217;s associated with sexual activities,&#x201D; said Ashley Styczynski, an assistant professor in the Department of Infectious Diseases and CDC medical officer. &#x201C;So I think that it potentially risks carrying out some of those themes, seeing issues around stigma and ostracizing people.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Salinas, the important issue is to tackle the larger issue of the virus without harmfully singling out the groups that are currently most affected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;This [outbreak] has nothing to do with the population. It has everything to do with the virus,&#x201D; he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Styczynski, the CDC and news broadcasts have so far avoided creating a stigma against afflicted individuals through approachable, specific messaging toward the populations at greatest risk &#x2014; providing those communities with data on the outbreak and allowing them to feel fully seen and supported in the health conversation.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I think it is important to not do what was done with the AIDS epidemic in closing off our minds to imagine that this could affect other populations, because that would be problematic and could be a blind spot in our approach,&#x201D; Styczynski said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Salinas, who is currently collecting samples from a monkeypox-infected patient for a small-scale study on the virus, added that, &#x201C;We would be making a mistake if we think that monkeypox will only be transmitted in [the LGBTQ+ community].&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He recommends continuing to follow the COVID-19 safety measures to combat monkeypox, including wearing a mask in crowded indoor spaces and practicing safe sex measures, with awareness to the infection status of sexual partners. For those who notice newly-developed bodily rashes or any other indication of monkeypox, Salinas suggests having their symptoms diagnosed to prevent further transmission.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After researching and working toward treatment for COVID-19 and monkeypox, Styczynski recognized the need to fund public health institutions and expand community resources &#x2014; a gap exposed by the pandemic.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;We have to build our public health infrastructure before we&#x2019;re ready to take this on in full force,&#x201D; she said, underscoring the urgency of providing medical and educational resources in areas most impacted by monkeypox.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;We need to have our finger on the pulse early, we need to be paying attention,&#x201D; Styczynski added. &#x201C;If we pay attention before it&#8217;s a crisis, we can prevent it from becoming one. &#x201C;But if we wait to care until it&#x2019;s a crisis, then we will be too late.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Monkeypox, a disease characterized by rash-like blisters, is spreading in the U.S., but is rarely fatal and much less

Carat Toothache\u201d: an emotional, lyrically complex production lacking in musical ambition"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>After over three years of inactivity from the hip-hop and pop artist Post Malone, the release of &#x201C;Twelve Carat Toothache&#x201D; diverges greatly from the style and sound of any of his past albums. The glaring differences in lyricism and production featured in this album may be a signal to fans that Post Malone is maturing as his music- making career progresses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To say Post Malone&#x2019;s career has been outstanding would be an understatement. Ever since his introduction to the music industry in 2016, Post Malone has climbed his way to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm7970428\/bio\">top of the charts<\/a> faster than almost any other artist of his time, captivating fans year after year through memorable hits such as &#x201C;Rockstar&#x201D; and &#x201C;Circles.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Post Malone&#x2019;s previous albums &#x201C;Beerbongs &amp; Bentleys&#x201D; and &#x201C;Hollywood&#x2019;s Bleeding&#x201D; aimed strictly for radio play and largely avoided the topic of his emotions, &#x201C;Twelve Carat Toothache&#x201D; sidelines the priorities of the artist&#x2019;s past releases. Instead of giving audiences an instantly engaging and digestible tracklist, the album offers mellow instrumentals and nuanced lyrics that require multiple listens to fully understand.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Twelve Carat Toothache&#x201D; was poorly received by most audiences despite debuting at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.billboard.com\/music\/chart-beat\/post-malone-twelve-carat-toothache-five-burning-questions-1235087206\/\">No. 2 on the Billboard Top 200<\/a> after its release on June 3, 2022. Grossing over 75% fewer first week sales and fewer streams than &#x201C;Hollywood&#x2019;s Bleeding,&#x201D; &#x201C;Twelve Carat Toothache&#x201D; sacrifices its musical quality and production for more lyrical expression. A first listen of the album uncovers significant flaws in forgettable choruses and bland hooks, but paying closer attention to the artist&#x2019;s words reveals &#x201C;Twelve Carat Toothache&#x201D; to be Post Malone&#x2019;s most narratively and lyrically deep album yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The album delves into Post Malone&#x2019;s battle with depression &#x2014; a struggle that has plagued him ever since his rise to fame. In his opening track &#x201C;Reputation,&#x201D; he includes unapologetic references to the topic of suicide, abandoning the playful personality of his previous albums and addressing a darker side of his life. He then tackles his issues with alcoholism head-on in &#x201C;Love\/Hate Letter To Alcohol&#x201D;; in a vignette where a drunken fight almost leads to Post Malone&#x2019;s death, the artist ascribes alcohol as the source of his problems while also singing in the chorus, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re the only way to drown my sadness.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In &#x201C;Lemon Tree,&#x201D; Post Malone conveys his envy toward those around him who aren&#x2019;t dealing with the same internal demons. In the song, he describes others as growing metaphorical apples and tangerines while he is stuck with a sour lemon tree. However, the track also includes a glimmer of hope for the artist, who vows to burn down his lemon tree and &#x201C;grow [him] something better.&#x201D; He alludes to the prospect of his self-improvement despite having to deal with great setbacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lacking the record-breaking hits boasted by its predecessors, &#x201C;Twelve Carat Toothache&#x201D; suffers from its basic instrumentation and somewhat boring melodies, offering audiences nothing more than a mediocre listening experience. The album&#x2019;s excessive use of reverb muddles Post Malone&#x2019;s vocals, blending his voice with the background instrumentals to the point where each song sounds messy. The repetitive style and unchanging themes of depression and alcoholism in each song causes the album to grow stale after the first couple of tracks &#x2014; a sign that the artist may be taking a step back from exploring new sounds to instead open up about his personal life to listeners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Twelve Carat Toothache&#x201D; contains many profound stories about Post Malone&#x2019;s life, but these lyrics overshadow the artist&#x2019;s musical production which often took the foreground in previous albums. &#x201C;Twelve Carat Toothache&#x201D; may not have the ear-catching hits to make it a top selling album, but Post Malone masterfully uses his lyrics as a medium to spill his feelings out to his audience. The album may have disappointed some listeners, but for the artist, it could be a stepping stone toward something greater.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cTwelve Carat

the last three days of competition at the 2022 FINA World Aquatics Championships in Budapest, Hungary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their efforts brought the overall Cardinal medal count for the championship to 14, including eight golds, two silvers and four bronzes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Records and relay wins for Huske, Smith and Curzan<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Thursday, rising sophomore Torri Huske broke the American record in the semifinals of the women&#x2019;s 50-meter butterfly with a time of 25.38. She took sixth in the finals, with a slightly slower time of 25.45.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t know the [record] time, so I didn&#x2019;t know I broke it until you just told me,&#x201D; Huske <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usaswimming.org\/news\/2022\/06\/23\/world-titles-relay-gold-and-new-american-record-on-day-six\">said<\/a> in an interview with NBC after the semifinals. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m really happy with how the meet&#x2019;s gone so far and I&#x2019;m really excited with what&#x2019;s left to come.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Huske placed fifth in the 50-meter freestyle and took bronze in the 100-meter freestyle, clocking a personal record of 52.92 in the latter. Her total of six medals has her tied with Australia&#8217;s Mollie O&#x2019;Callaghan as the swimmer with the most medals at this World Championships meet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incoming freshman Claire Curzan competed in the 50 butterfly and 100 freestyle, finishing fourth and eighth with times of 24.43 and 53.81, respectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Future teammates Huske and Curzan competed on two more relays during the last three days of the meet. They recorded splits of 52.70 and 52.84 in the 4&#215;100 mixed freestyle relay, taking bronze alongside their American teammates, Ryan Held and Brooks Curry, with a time of 3:21.09.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taylor Ruck &#x2019;22 also competed on the mixed freestyle relay though she only swam in the preliminary heats. She recorded a split of 53.92, helping Canada advance to the finals, where they ultimately took silver. Ruck was awarded a silver for her efforts in preliminary heats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the women&#x2019;s 4&#215;100 medley relay, Huske and Curzan competed with rising sophomore Regan Smith alongside Lily King. Smith recorded a time of 58.40 on the backstroke leg &#x2014; the second-fastest split across all the backstroke legs. Huske split 56.66 on butterfly, the second-fastest of the butterflyers and Curzan recorded a 52.82 on freestyle, the fourth-fastest of the freestylers. The relay team took gold with a time of 3:53.78.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Huske and Curzan each swam a total of 16 races across the course of the Championships, including preliminary heats, semifinals, finals and relays.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ledecky gets the five-peat<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie Ledecky &#x2BC;20 won the women&#x2019;s 800-meter freestyle with a time of 8:08.04 on Friday. It was the fifth-fastest performance in the history of the event, behind four of Ledecky&#x2019;s past&nbsp;performances. With her win, Ledecky became the only athlete at this meet to earn three individual gold medals. She previously <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/21\/cardinal-women-make-a-splash-amid-2022-world-championships\/\">won<\/a> the 400 and 1500-meter freestyles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ledecky has not lost in the 800-meter freestyle since 2012, also taking gold at the last five World Championships.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I think back to London [the 2012 Olympics], and I made it a goal to not be a one-hit wonder,&#x201D; Ledecky <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usaswimming.org\/news\/2022\/06\/24\/ledecky-accomplishes-historic-800-free-feat-at-fina-world-championships\">told <\/a>USA Swimming. &#x201C;Here we are 10 years later, so I&#x2019;m really proud of that, and I&#x2019;m still excited for the future as well.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ledecky is the only swimmer to win a World Championship gold in the same event five consecutive times. With 14 individual World titles, she is one win away from tying Michael Phelps for the most individual World Championship titles.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Stanford-affiliated athletes closed out the 2022 meet helping their national teams to several podium finishes across a variety of events.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1003325,"featured_media":1206007,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[23,45418,646],"tags":[78251,78280,78241,78276,27309,14631,78278,74699,78279,35626,901,1029,687,51687,71346],"site-layouts":[77066],"coauthors":[78244],"parsely":{"version":"1.1.0","meta":{"@context":"https:\/\/schema.org","@type":"NewsArticle","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/07\/01\/cardinal-swimmers-finish-with-14-medals-at-world-championships\/"},"headline":"Cardinal swimmers finish with 14 medals at World Championships","url":"http:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/07\/01\/cardinal-swimmers-finish-with-14-medals-at-world-championships\/","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Flags_JT_021321_2462.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Flags_JT_021321_2462.jpg"},"dateCreated":"2022-07-02T03:50:55Z","datePublished":"2022-07-02T03:50:55Z","dateModified":"2022-07-02T04:38:38Z","articleSection":"Women's Swimming &amp;

and UCLA are leaving the Pac-12: The Stanford Daily staff reacts"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p><em>Thursday morning, Jon Wilner <\/em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wilnerhotline\/status\/1542559346453729281?s=20&amp;t=Xq7SHfvJrtK_qI835hmEiA\" target=\"_blank\">reported<\/a><em> that Pac-12 founding members UCLA and USC were planning to leave the conference for the Big Ten in 2024. Hours later, the two schools were notified their application to join the conference had been accepted. The two Los Angeles-based schools are set to compete in the Big Ten in all sports except beach volleyball. This is just the latest news in the recent run of conference realignments in collegiate athletics, and many expect it to cause a ripple effect for the remaining members of the Pac-12 and other conferences. Already in the few hours after the news broke, several schools across the country have reportedly contacted different conferences about joining.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Daily&#x2019;s Tammer Bagdasarian, Ells Boone, Noah Maltzman, Kaushik Sampath, Jibriel Taha and Zach Zafran offer their thoughts on the future of the conference, what it means for the Cardinal and more.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are your initial thoughts on UCLA and USC planning a move to the Big Ten?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Noah Maltzman (NM):<\/strong> This is the start of the dissolution of the Pac-12 Conference, no doubt about it. After what occurred this past year &#x2014; Cincinnati, Houston, BYU and UCF moving to the Big 12 and Texas and Oklahoma moving to the SEC &#x2014; it is evident that schools are shifting to join bigger conferences for their name and reputation. I see a lot of similarities between this and athletes transferring to bigger schools to gain more exposure which could lead to a bigger NIL deal, for example forward Kevin Obanor transferring from Oral Roberts to Texas Tech. But as far as I am concerned, this is purely a financial move in order to gain more revenue for the Los Angeles schools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Zach Zafran (ZZ):<\/strong> Money grab, money grab! But what isn&#x2019;t nowadays? The worst part is that the decision is short-sighted. Not in terms of time, but depth of impact. This is a decision obviously keeping the best interest of football and basketball in mind, and nothing else. What about the other sports? The only positive thing to come of this choice is that the Pac-12&#x2019;s marketing team will have an easy job of digging out old Pac-10 merch from boxes in the back of the closet.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tammer Bagdasarian (TB):<\/strong> I grew up a diehard Bruins fan (I know, heresy for a Cardinal). There was an identity there, a unique west coast feel, a pride in the competition and storylines grounded in decades of history. I&#x2019;ll never stop rooting for the downfall of the lesser caniform (the Cal Bears), waiting for a chance to jump on the grimy Arizona State Sun Devils or holding my breath for a moment that we may, one day, be able to put the prideful Oregon Ducks into the ground. The unshakeable enmity toward our superior conference rivals that makes a football game feel like Hellenistic warfare is the product of more than two decades of mediocrity, but it was a mediocrity we lived and died by. Simply put, the move hurts a bit. It does make sense, though. The past few years have shown nothing if not that the NCAA&#x2019;s big name sports are, first and foremost, a business. The country&#x2019;s second biggest media market wasn&#x2019;t going to stay in a middling conference that has been slowly losing legitimacy for years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kaushik Sampath (KS):<\/strong> This is an unbearable loss for the Pac-12. USC and UCLA are the two most visible college sports brands in the conference, and both are bluebloods in at least one of the revenue sports. Additionally, the quality of play within the conference will likely go down in both football and men&#x2019;s basketball. Both football teams were looking to be very good for the foreseeable future, and both had accomplished and experienced head coaches directing their programs. In basketball, the Pac-12 only sent three teams to the NCAA tournament this past year, and two of them were UCLA and USC. The Pac-12 just hasn&#x2019;t been good in any of the revenue sports for the past half decade, and many of the programs in the conference have limitations like academics or poor in-state talent that prevent them from reaching the top. These two programs had the most potential to bring back success and national recognition to the conference, but now that ship has sailed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What does this mean for the future of Stanford Athletics?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jibriel Taha (JT):<\/strong> It&#x2019;s unclear at this point, but it doesn&#x2019;t look great. Aside from the obvious revenue loss that comes with this move, two of Stanford&#x2019;s biggest recruiting rivals will now play in a superior conference, and are able to sell having more eyeballs and thus more NIL money to their athletes. What Stanford decides to do next is a mystery. Will it try to stay with the Pac-12 and poach teams from smaller conferences? Look to convince a power conference to take them because of the Bay Area market and Stanford&#x2019;s academic prowess? Become independent? Join the Ivy League? Stanford&#x2019;s administration will have decisions to make in this fluid situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ZZ:<\/strong> I would argue its direct impact on Stanford is minimal, but indirectly, the move further hinders an athletic reputation that has seen colossal regression during recent years. Losing control of the Director&#x2019;s Cup back-to-back years (after a 25-year streak) coupled with poor performances across many media-heavy sports has reduced Stanford to little in the you-get-some-respect-for-your-sports circle. Now that USC and UCLA, heavy hitters for the Pac-12 across all sports, will be gone from the conference, Stanford fans can&#x2019;t even default to their position in a reputable conference.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TB:<\/strong> I&#x2019;d have to imagine that Bernard Muir is panicking a bit right now. Though, for the man who was willing to cut 11 storied programs at the snap of a finger, maybe athletic legitimacy isn&#x2019;t at the top of the priority list. As Zafran highlighted, Stanford Athletics has been on a steady decline for years now. Maybe this is the wake-up call that Palo Alto needed. Still, what are our options? Jump ship and try to assemble another conference? While appealing, it&#x2019;s unclear whether the Bay Area college sports market holds much weight in negotiations. Try to dominate the soon-to-be Pac-10? That wouldn&#x2019;t mean much, especially if Oregon exits the conference soon too. Hire Andrew Luck as head coach and go win a national championship? One can only hope. Making predictions is a waste of energy in such a tumultuous industry. Nonetheless, whatever move comes next will help define the future of a Stanford Athletics program that desperately needs to rediscover its identity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ells Boone (EB):<\/strong> Point blank period, this is not good for Stanford. It forces the administration and Bernard Muir to make a decision about what they want the future of Cardinal athletics to be, and given that group&#x2019;s recent track record with decisions about Stanford sports, it could be a scary time for us diehard fans. It will ultimately come down to how aggressive the administration is. Do they immediately search for a way into the Big Ten or the Big XII? Do they sit back and hope George Kliavkoff and the Pac-12 can hold on to the rest of its members and look to add in outsiders like San Diego State or Boise State? Do they become disillusioned by the future of big time collegiate athletics and jump ship for the Ivy League, doing away with athletic scholarships altogether in what would be a nightmare scenario? The future, for now, is unclear, but a decision will have to be made in the coming months as conference realignment waits for no man.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NM:<\/strong> At a superficial glance, this looks to be great for Cardinal recruiting. Both David Shaw and Jerod Haase could benefit from this if they capitalize on the power vacuum in both football and basketball respectively. Specifically, both could recruit without competing as much against Lincoln Riley&#x2019;s Trojans &#x2013; who have taken advantage of the transfer portal to land key players like quarterback Caleb Williams and wide receiver Jordan Addison &#x2013; and Mick Cronin&#x2019;s Bruins &#x2013; who just this year landed two five-star recruits in combo-guard Amari Bailey and center Adem Bona. Hopefully, Stanford will have an easier time attracting players to their teams because these recruiting powerhouses will no longer be in the conference; however, this hinges on the Cardinal&#x2019;s ability to win games consistently. If this was last decade, when David Shaw was just starting his Stanford career, or even earlier during the Lopez twins&#8217; (&#x2018;10) era, this would hands down be fantastic for Stanford Athletics. Stanford needs to start winning again to gain these possible recruits (specifically for football and men&#8217;s basketball &#x2014; the two most profitable sports) &#x2014; and this winning needs to start with the coaching.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Will we ultimately see college conferences merge into two &#x201C;super-conferences&#x201D;?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>KS:<\/strong> It&#x2019;s hard to say. The Big Ten and the SEC already concentrate most of the top programs in the country in football and basketball. But there are a few schools out there that are a powerhouse in one sport but are mediocre in the rest. These include Kansas, Duke, Clemson and others. It remains to be seen how the conferences will deal with them. Also, what will happen to those who are powerhouses in one sport, but don&#x2019;t offer football like Gonzaga? If the SEC or Big Ten decide to invite these schools then I believe that we will essentially be dealing with two power conferences, and if you&#x2019;re outside these conferences, certain college sports won&#x2019;t be worth having from a monetary standpoint. In the far future, there&#x2019;s also the possibility that both the SEC and Big Ten merge into one conglomerate conference. The demand for the top teams in both conferences to play each other frequently may incentivize this. I mean who wouldn&#x2019;t want to see a football game between Ohio State and Alabama frequently?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>EB:<\/strong> It certainly looks like things are trending that way. The SEC will already effectively be a super-conference once Oklahoma and Texas officially join and bring the conference&#x2019;s membership to 16 schools. The Big Ten will be at 16 once USC and UCLA complete their move, and are sure to try to add even more. The ACC may be able to hold off on losing members from its 15-team conference, but there have been rumblings that the Big Ten could be looking at Duke and UNC. I am sure the SEC would love to have Clemson, Florida State and Miami. Hopefully, the ACC stays as it is now, and the Big XII gets boosted by the additions of BYU, Cincinnati, Houston and UCF. If the ACC starts to lose members, the super-conference era is upon us. However, if they stay intact, collegiate athletics should be able to move forward under the same model.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NM:<\/strong> Like Boone said, the train certainly seems to be headed in that direction &#x2013; with a lot of coal left in the tank. Judging the current collegiate athletic landscape, specifically for football and men&#8217;s basketball, schools are trending to join better conferences for financial gain. If I were to guess which two conferences would be the &#x201C;super-conferences,&#x201D; it would probably be the Big 10 and the SEC, the two conferences definitively the best at the most profitable sport: football. Is this a good thing? Absolutely not. Conferences bring diversity to tournaments like the College Football Playoff (CFP) or March Madness, getting rid of this diversity will only lead to more of the same teams getting into the playoff. This is already a problem for the CFP, which has an easy solution (expand the playoffs to at least eight teams!!), but having two &#x201C;super-conferences&#x201D; will further worsen the issue in football, and make an issue out of nothing for both men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s March Madness tournaments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is this fair for non-revenue sport athletes in regards to travel time and other considerations?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ZZ:<\/strong> If you think about current Big 10 schools scheduling for USC and UCLA, it&#x2019;s not that bad. They can schedule competitions back-to-back, make one trip out to the West Coast and call it a day. Even the football schedule could be accommodating if they schedule one LA school for a home game and the other for an away game during each season. But on the flip side, it&#x2019;s an absolute nightmare. How is someone with a full course load and involvement in other activities&nbsp;supposed to handle this? Games with Rutgers will be a nightmare: a flight over five hours long in addition to an hour-plus drive. And it&#x2019;s not like the Penn State or Maryland trips will be much better. And are we forgetting about sports like baseball or softball? Teams consistently play north of 60 games a season? Forget calling them student-athletes, this move effectively strips them of being a student at school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TB:<\/strong> It is becoming increasingly clear that the country&#x2019;s biggest programs pay little attention to the &#x201C;college&#x201D; part of college athletics. Certainly, travel time will be devastating to the health of many non-football athletes at UCLA and USC, many of whom will soon spend the vast majority of their season in buses, planes and hotels. But what about the actual competition, something that UCLA and USC maintain they truly care about? For most sports, the Pac-12 is one of the most balanced and well-distributed conferences in the country. Once the schools move to another conference, we will undoubtedly see a weakening of the majority of their non-revenue sports. These programs are truly signing their fates as &#x201C;football schools.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What&#x2019;s one storyline you&#x2019;ll be keeping your eyes on as this story progresses?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>JT:<\/strong> How quickly will the rest of the Pac-12 abandon ship? Oregon and Washington have compelling brands, so I doubt they will sit tight. With the Big 10 demonstrating its willingness to disregard geographic concerns, these two schools could try to follow the LA schools. Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado and Utah could all look to join the Big 12, and I assume that the Big 12 would love to have all four of them. I also think that the Big 12 would take Oregon and Washington, if the Big 10 does not want them. So will these schools stick with the Pac-12 for now, or quickly give up on the conference?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TB:<\/strong> The Nerd Conference! If the Pac-12 ends up completely splintering, Stanford will be forced to look somewhere else for competition. Proposed originally on Twitter by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PFTCommenter\/status\/1542567408644358144?s=20&amp;t=hoAyqDhLB03EXWTQyyAWkw\">@PFTCommentor<\/a>, a nerd conference could comprise Stanford, Notre Dame, Duke, Northwestern and Rice. Add in Virginia and Vanderbilt and you have a real collection of schools defined by &#x201C;intellectual brutality.&#x201D; Though the concerns about geography would still remain, at least this conference would be a fun one, filled with powerhouse programs that would absolutely stomp on Stanford Basketball.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>KS:<\/strong> What teams will the Pac-12 try to bring in next? I could see the Pac-12 trying to invite some MWC schools like Boise State or San Diego State due to the success of their football programs and basketball programs in recent years. However, these additions definitely would not recoup the money the Pac-12 will lose from UCLA and USC jumping ship. The Pac-12 could try to go the direction of the Big East and specialize in one sport like basketball. Gonzaga and St. Mary&#x2019;s joining the conference would be a nice first step towards that. Whichever way they go, the Pac-12 offices need to come up with a quick plan and take action fast or else the conference will be left in the dust.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>EB:<\/strong> The future of the Pac-12. Will it still be a conference in five years? Will it be aggressive and hold on to its remaining members and look to fill in two to four more schools? As Taha mentioned, Oregon and Washington will almost certainly be trying to join the L.A. schools in the Big 10. Colorado &#x2014; a former Big XII member &#x2014; along with Utah, Arizona and Arizona State may be enticed by the Big XII. That leaves Stanford, Cal, Washington State and Oregon State to fend for themselves. Maybe the conference restructures around those four and tries to incorporate parts of the Mountain West Conference, by bringing in the likes of San Diego State, Wyoming, UNLV, Boise State, Colorado State and Nevada. The biggest splash the Pac-12 could make would be adding Gonzaga from the West Coast Conference. That would help to restore some relevancy to its basketball league that was hit hard by UCLA&#x2019;s departure. Admittedly, it is not looking good for the flagship conference of the west coast.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ZZ:<\/strong> I refrained from answering whether or not we will see the rise of two super-conferences, partially because I don&#x2019;t want to manifest it. But that storyline is exactly what I&#x2019;ll be looking out for. Already we&#x2019;re seeing college sports begin a period of evolution in many regards: NIL, conference realignment, media involvement &#x2014; you name it. One byproduct of this process very well may be a pair of super-conferences that largely parallels a lot of professional sports leagues. But will the formation of such a system facilitate exciting, competitive play? We will have to wait and see.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NM:<\/strong> Before coming to Stanford, I was (and still am) a massive Michigan fan. How USC and UCLA will affect the Big 10 is a huge story for both Big 10 and Pac 12 fans alike. USC and UCLA are hoping to join the Big 10, but personally, I just do not think they belong. They do not have the Big 10 grit and tenacity that cold winters bring to football games. Try all they want, I think that the move will be a detriment to all parties involved: USC, UCLA, the Pac 12 and the Big 10. For USC and UCLA, they are playing significantly more challenging opponents in the three highest-revenue collegiate sports (football, men&#8217;s basketball and baseball). Like I said, I am very biased, but moving to a conference where three teams have made the CFP and another two could very realistically do it will be hard for their football programs. In addition to the team strength, the fans of Big 10 schools are a different breed of loyal. Those conference matchups at Nebraska, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio State, Penn State and company will be tough, regardless of their five hour flights, minimum two-hour time difference and level of team they play &#x2014; homefield advantage is a serious aspect of Big 10 football that the two Los Angeles schools will not be ready to handle. But back to the original question, should the move happen, I think the main story will be how UCLA and USC fit in with the Big 10 aesthetic and attitude, which I predict will not be the fit they wanted.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Thursday morning, news broke that USC and UCLA will be leaving the Pac-12 in favor of the Big Ten conference.

His retirement will begin mere hours after the Supreme Court releases its final rulings of this term.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;It has been my great honor to participate as a judge in the effort to maintain our Constitution and Rule of Law,&#x201D; he wrote. &#x201C;I have found the work challenging and meaningful.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Breyer&#x2019;s retirement has been in the works for months &#x2014; the justice <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2022\/01\/26\/supreme-court-justice-stephen-breyer-to-retire-giving-biden-a-chance-to-nominate-a-replacement.html\" target=\"_blank\">announced<\/a> in January that he intended to retire to allow President Joe Biden the opportunity to replace the liberal justice during his term in office.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Born in San Francisco, California in 1938, Breyer is the Court&#x2019;s oldest member at 83 years old. He received his Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy from Stanford University in 1959, graduating with membership in the academic honor society, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pbk.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Phi Beta Kappa<\/a>. He would go on to study at Oxford and Harvard and spend eight years in the U.S. Army Reserves before being honorably discharged in 1965.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1993, he was considered for the vacancy that would be filled by late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Breyer joined the court the following year, confirmed by an 87 to 9 senate vote, after the retirement of Harry Blackburn. In his time on the Court, Breyer was known for his pragmatic approach to justice, considering the real-life consequences of court decisions while still respecting the decisions made by the legislature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2000, Breyer wrote the majority opinion in <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.oyez.org\/cases\/1999\/99-830\" target=\"_blank\">Stenberg v Carhart<\/a>, striking down a Nebraska law that banned partial-birth abortions.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, he dissented on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.oyez.org\/cases\/2014\/14-7955\" target=\"_blank\">Glossip v. Gross<\/a>, a case that dealt with the death penalty, and called on the Court to directly examine the constitutionality of the death penalty, writing that it was &#x201C;highly likely that the death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Breyer maintained his strong devotion to the job, writing momentous opinions until his final day on the Court. Just last week, he was one of three dissenters on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.oyez.org\/cases\/2021\/19-1392\" target=\"_blank\">Dobbs v. Jackson<\/a> which <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2022\/06\/24\/1102305878\/supreme-court-abortion-roe-v-wade-decision-overturn\" target=\"_blank\">overturned<\/a> the precedent created by <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.oyez.org\/cases\/1971\/70-18\" target=\"_blank\">Roe v. Wade<\/a> and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.oyez.org\/cases\/1991\/91-744\" target=\"_blank\">Planned Parenthood v. Casey<\/a> which defended abortion as a constitutional right.

feedback is necessary for graduate admissions"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>7:25 p.m. &#x2014; I nervously checked the time on my computer, while wiping away the beads of sweat that had started to form on my forehead. I had been praying, nay, pleading, for the last 10 minutes &#x2014; &#x201C;Please let this interview go well.&#x201D; I was on my last set of graduate school interviews. This was my last chance, I had been rejected everywhere else. I had no idea what I was doing wrong &#x2014; the platitudes of &#x201C;just be yourself&#x201D; from my classmates rang hollow within me.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just internalized it &#x2014; if &#x201C;just be yourself&#x201D; was not working, then something was definitely wrong with me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7:29 p.m. &#x2014; One minute to go. I took a final swig of water and thought to myself, &#x201D;If I ever find myself on the other side of the table, won&#x2019;t I change a few things&#x2026;&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been two years since that fateful interview day. Although I am currently a graduate student here at Stanford, I still have no idea what happened and why I was admitted. But in those two years, the pressing need to figure out what went wrong with the other interviews never left me. &#x201C;Why do you care, you are already at Stanford?&#x201D; was the common reaction I got from my acquaintances whenever I brought it up.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I do care &#x2014; I care deeply. Not because of my ego, but because of the reason why I am in graduate school. I am training to become a better engineer and scientist. And the only way to become a better engineer and scientist is through feedback.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As scientists, we receive feedback from every single situation &#x2014; when we submit manuscripts, we receive feedback from the editors and peer reviewers. When we submit grants, we receive feedback from NSF and NIH panelists. When we defend or give our qualifying examinations, we get feedback from our committee members and those who listen to us. When we go up for tenure, we get feedback from the tenure committee. Every basic interaction between lab colleagues allows us to refine and change our ideas and methods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So why is it that admissions, perhaps the most critical part of one&#8217;s journey to becoming a scientist, has to be the most Kafkaesque process? Departments at Stanford have policies that they will not release feedback about their decisions to students. Let me again point out how asinine that is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As scientists, we strive for clarity, reproducibility and evidence &#x2014; if there is no clear criteria for those who are admitted and those who are not, we are creating a game of chance, an unequal opportunity between those who understand the &#x201C;game&#x201D; and those who do not.&nbsp; For many of us who have been admitted, it is a case of survivorship bias; we may not care about what our interviewers thought &#x2014; we got in.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the reality is that there are hundreds of others who haven&#x2019;t gotten in &#x2014; there is about a 10% acceptance rate in my department. For many of them, who passed the initial screening and reached the interview stage, having that extra feedback from the professors who spent the time interacting with the applicant will go a long way in helping their futures in other grad school interviews, or in general become better at the interview process. By denying all of this, growth is stunted.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In particular, this unduly affects groups who are less likely to understand the &#x201C;game&#x201D; &#x2014; first-time higher education seekers, immigrants, people of color and people from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, as evidenced by the Department of Education&#x2019;s own <a href=\"https:\/\/www2.ed.gov\/rschstat\/research\/pubs\/advancing-diversity-inclusion.pdf\">report<\/a> on higher education statistics.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some may argue that people do not have time to respond to the potentially hundreds of applicants. However, federal grant agencies illustrate that it is possible to make the time; many national grant agencies, in particular NSF and NIH, return grant feedback to submitters. If federal grant agencies and reviewers can afford to spend time to give feedback, so can admissions committees. While departments may view giving feedback as an inefficient waste of time and resources, I would argue such feedback is valuable in the long term. Using the departments&#x2019; logic, growing a tree is a waste of time. It may be &#x201C;inefficient&#x201D; to take time out of our busy lives to water it, but over 50 years, when we are long gone, that tree will provide shade for those who didn&#x2019;t have it before. We do not see the tree grow day to day, but if we do not water it daily, the tree will die before it has a chance to rise. In the same way, by not giving the applicants feedback, we are failing potential scientists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A perhaps darker interpretation can be taken that the lack of feedback and clarity is useful for maintaining a sense of &#x201C;prestige&#x201D; in the institution. It would be a lie to say that we don&#x2019;t profit from this idea; a degree from Stanford opens up so many opportunities because of its exclusivity. Antonio Gramsci, an Italian 20th century political prisoner under Benito Mussolini, defined this as the idea of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/title\/prison-notebooks\/oclc\/24009547\">cultural hegemony<\/a> &#x2014; the ruling class&#x2019;s beliefs, thoughts and expectations become the dominant accepted cultural norm in a culturally diverse society. We are lucky that we have the choice to not perpetuate this hegemony; let us use this to enact change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is easy to enact policies at the top of the chain to promote better representation; the real challenge starts at the roots so that more trees have a chance to grow. We have to rethink how graduate school admissions works, and really provide equitable opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it is important for us to take this issue up with our departments here. For the small number of us currently in the program, we will not see any benefit from it, but I guarantee you, thousands will thank us for it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Soham Sinha argues that departments should provide feedback to graduate school applicants. &#8220;As scientists we strive for clarity, reproducibility, and evidence &#8211;

catastrophic\u2019: Stanford legal experts foretell grim future after reversal of Roe v. Wade"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>The Supreme Court effectively eliminated the constitutional right to abortion in a long-anticipated decision published Friday morning, nearly 50 years after a court of the same political composition enshrined that right in the landmark Roe v. Wade 1973 case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As thousands take to the streets to protest the ruling, both nationally and in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/2022\/06\/24\/the-bay-area-reels-as-roe-falls-ending-50-years-of-abortion-rights\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Bay<\/a>, Stanford-affiliated law experts agree that the Supreme Court&#x2019;s decision will foster legal turmoil for years to come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;This decision will wipe out the Court&#x2019;s remaining legitimacy,&#x201D; wrote former U.S. Senator Russell Feingold (D-Wis.), the president of the American Constitutional Society and an affiliate of the Stanford Constitutional Law Center, in a statement to The Daily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decades after Roe and the concurring 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey ruling dictated that states could not restrict reproductive decisions made before fetus viability outside of the womb, Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/article\/mississippi-abortion-law.html\">signed<\/a> a law that did just that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Jackson Women&#x2019;s Health Organization defied the law, Mississippi State Health Officer Thomas Dobbs petitioned federal courts, and Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x2019;s Health Organization made its way before the Supreme Court in late 2021. In early May, a <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/05\/04\/constitutional-earthquake-stanford-legal-experts-cast-grim-outlook-on-draft-opinion-overturning-roe-v-wade\/\">leaked<\/a> draft opinion by Samuel Alito presaged the overturn of Roe and <em>Casey<\/em> and shook the nation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;If this were the final opinion, it would be a constitutional earthquake that could put a wide range of previously-recognized constitutional rights in jeopardy,&#x201D; wrote Jane Schacter, a constitutional law scholar, in a May statement to The Daily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Schacter <a href=\"https:\/\/law.stanford.edu\/2022\/06\/24\/a-constitutional-earthquake-stanfords-jane-schacter-on-scotus-decision-to-overturn-roe-v-wade-ending-constitutional-right-to-an-abortion\/\">noted<\/a> on Friday that the Supreme Court&#x2019;s recent decisions &#x201C;closely track priorities of conservative politicians.&#x201D; She pointed to the Court&#x2019;s June 23 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.supremecourt.gov\/opinions\/21pdf\/20-843_7j80.pdf\">ruling<\/a> that nullified a New York law that required permits for gun owners to carry their weapons outside of their property.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rulings, Schacter said, are in step with how the Federalist Society &#x2014; a right-wing legal association that all Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices are affiliated with &#x2014; <a href=\"https:\/\/fedsoc.org\/about-us\">interprets<\/a> the Constitution.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;After informing us that the right to an abortion is not in the text of the Constitution, Alito then turns to &#x2018;history&#x2019; and his particular brand of originalism,&#x201D; wrote Rebecca Talbott, a Stanford Constitutional Law Center fellow and civil rights litigator. Echoing Schacter, Talbott continued that making decisions solely based on the original text has a chilling effect on rights for marginalized groups, including women. &#x201C;With originalism, we will always fail to find any rights for women that men would not have needed or wanted.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Law and sociology professor Michele Dauber, said that the decision returned women to the status of second-class citizens. She also warned of the grim reality that awaits many women in states that will outlaw abortions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;This decision provides no exceptions for rape and incest, meaning survivors will be forced in many states to have their rapist&#8217;s baby &#x2014; a level of cruelty that is hard to even fathom,&#x201D; Dauber wrote to The Daily. &#x201C;Women who are drug addicted will be denied abortions and then prosecuted and incarcerated for having babies born with drugs in their bloodstream. Women have been plunged into a dystopian hellscape.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, the Stanford Democrats Executive Board criticized anti-abortion rights claims of conservative politicians and judges, citing conservative obstruction to the <a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/6164873\/letter-biden-childcare-crisis\/\">expansion<\/a> of affordable child care, the permanent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/us-policy\/2022\/05\/03\/gop-families-roe-wade\/\">implementation<\/a> of the child-tax credit, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/transportation\/2021\/10\/15\/pete-buttigieg-time-off-parental-leave\/\">paid<\/a> paternal leave and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/business\/2021\/11\/30\/biden-universal-prek-gop\/\">realization<\/a> of universal preschool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;We repudiate anti-abortion Republicans&#x2019; claims to be &#x2018;pro-life&#x2019;,&#x201D; the Stanford Democrats Executive Board wrote to The Daily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talbott called it an &#x201C;irony&#x201D; that the states which will swiftly enact bans on abortions &#x201C;aren&#8217;t exactly leading the world in accessible and affordable prenatal and maternal health services, accessible and affordable child care, or accessible and affordable early childhood education and pre-K,&#x201D; which she said are critical support systems for a child&#x2019;s development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;You wonder why we seem to only care about our nation&#8217;s children so long as they&#8217;re in someone&#8217;s womb,&#x201D; Talbott wrote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regarding the legal ramifications of the ruling, Talbott described how Alito&#x2019;s majority opinion &#x201C;paid fealty to precedent&#x201D; only when it suited his decision. She noted that Alito suggested that rule by precedent meant Americans would &#x201C;still be governed by Plessy v. Ferguson and Dred Scott&#x201D; while simultaneously citing other precedent as justification for denying a place for abortion rights in the 14th Amendment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dauber forecasted that the overturn of Roe may be just the beginning of the right&#x2019;s rewriting of social privileges, citing the Life at Conception Act supported by 164 U.S. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/117th-congress\/house-bill\/1011\/cosponsors\">Representatives<\/a> and 19 U.S. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/117th-congress\/senate-bill\/99\/cosponsors\">Senators<\/a> that will outlaw morning-after pills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;The people who are leading this movement are intent on women&#x2019;s sexual autonomy, and abortion is only the first step,&#x201D; Dauber wrote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the decision&#x2019;s impact on abortion rights, Talbott warned the Court&#x2019;s justification could lead to the reversal of landmark rulings protecting the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oyez.org\/cases\/2014\/14-556\">right<\/a> to gay marriage, same-sex <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oyez.org\/cases\/2002\/02-102\">relations<\/a> in general and the right of couples to buy and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oyez.org\/cases\/1964\/496\">use<\/a> contraception without government restriction.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that &#x201C;substantive due process distorts other areas of constitutional law&#x201D; and that &#x201C;we should reconsider all of this Court&#x2019;s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell&#x201D; &#x2014; the very cases Talbott listed. The Stanford Democrats decried Thomas&#x2019;s sentiment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;We have no doubt that the noxious partisan agenda at play in Dobbs v. Jackson (2022) will influence justices&#x2019; reasoning as these additional rights come under threat,&#x201D; they wrote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stanford Constitutional Law Center director Michael McConnell, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, expressed hope that states could use this decision to find a middle ground on the issue of reproductive rights, though he feared it may not occur in the near future.

Main-campus employees have been instructed to return to their routines prior to the disruption, and labs will also gradually reopen once power is restored.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The University advised that, when returning to housing and work stations, &#x201C;ensure cooking and heating appliances are safely turned off,&#x201D; and check for any equipment that is not functioning&nbsp; properly. Food in refrigerators and freezers may be spoiled and should be discarded as well. Students impacted by the power outage may file a Power Outage Support Request to cover food spoilage, eating out due to a lack of access to cooking and medication replacement, a University spokesperson told The Daily. Students are eligible for an emergency stipend of $100 to help with expenses and additional funding for medicine replacement. As for those in research spaces, the University is encouraging them to also check for &#x201C;any heating or heat-producing equipment that may have been left in the on position and survey workspaces.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;We want to thank the members of our campus community for your patience over the past days,&#x201D; University officials wrote, &#x201C;and extend special appreciation to the incredible groups of university staff who have worked tirelessly to restore power, support students living on campus and uphold research.&#x201D;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Students and faculty on campus should expect power to return in increments throughout today and the weekend, as crews are

cancels classes, will remain \u2018in the dark\u2019 for days to come"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Stanford canceled summer session classes for Thursday and Friday and is encouraging employees to work from home amid an ongoing power outage that has halted life on the Farm. Though there is no concrete timeline established, University officials shared Thursday evening that they remain &#x201C;cautiously optimistic,&#x201D; not certain, that full power will be restored to the main campus by the upcoming weekend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, &#8220;the timing could change,&#x201D; according to the email.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, once PG&amp;E completes repairs and restores the power supply to the main campus, it can also take several hours to safely re-energize campus facilities. &#x201C;We do not expect resumption of full campus activities until Monday at earliest,&#x201D; they added.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of Wednesday, PG&amp;E had not provided a concrete timeline for the restoration. The University made the decision to cancel classes citing the &#x201C;increasing possibility of a multiple-day disruption and the time required to re-start classrooms and equipment even once power is restored,&#x201D; according to an Alert SU sent that evening.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The power failure, which began Tuesday, June 21 from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sfchronicle.com\/california-wildfires\/article\/Edgewood-Fire-update-Blaze-burning-near-Edgewood-17257753.php\">local fire<\/a> damage in the PG&amp;E substations in the Interstate-280 region near San Mateo County, has forced students to rely on university resources and word from communications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Department of Comparative Medicine shared with students in an email that they are hopeful that<br>&#x201C;PG&amp;E will be able to perform repairs to the main power feed (Jefferson Line) to the Stanford Campus and local communities in 2-3 days.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While PG&amp;E is provided limited power through a secondary line, the University stated that campus buildings &#x201C;with the highest priority needs&#x201D; are being prioritized because it is not enough to support normal operations, especially with unusually <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sfchronicle.com\/bayarea\/article\/Summer-arrives-Tuesday-with-a-100-degree-heat-17254375.php\">hot weather<\/a> in the bay. Buildings of most importance include the Stanford hospital and &#x201C;critical infrastructure on campus.&#x201D; Many should expect no additional buildings will be supplied with normal power as Stanford continues to operate in a limited capacity on emergency generators, according to The Department of Comparative Medicine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Distributing power to other important sectors of campus remains a challenge. &#x201C;Allocation of resources for research continuity remains a priority,&#x201D; The University wrote. &#x201C;However, researchers should continue to refrain from performing any non-critical activities on the main campus.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside classes, conference activities are being held in alternative spaces. For the remainder of the week, Bing Nursery School, Madera Grove, CCSC and Stock Farm Road childcare facilities will also be closed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>University spokesperson E.J. Miranda reiterated to The Daily that all students have access to meals and respite spaces with air conditioning, and that outlets to charge electronics are available for all students at these locations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For graduate students who need immediate assistance, Miranda wrote that they can contact the graduate life dean on call by either emailing a message with phone number and reason for paging to <a href=\"mailto:25085@pageme.stanford.edu\">25085@pageme.stanford.edu<\/a>. Students can also contact the Stanford Operator at (650) 723-7288 and provide them with pager ID #25085.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In another email, Miranda wrote that the Deans of the Graduate Life office &#x201C;contacted all students in isolation to ask if they had specific needs.&#x201D; For isolating students who need access to external power sources to recharge their electronic devices, charging stations are available in outdoor areas at the GCC and Studio 2 in outdoor locations. Isolating students were told to wear a mask if they needed to go to a charging station to charge their electronics, Miranda wrote to the Daily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Miranda wrote to the Daily that &#x201C;resident students impacted by the power outage may file a <a href=\"https:\/\/forms.gle\/EFijhKAqp8foUb2e6\">Power Outage Support Request<\/a>,&#x201D; with students being eligible for an emergency stipend of $100 to help with expenses related to food spoilage and eating out, and additional funding available for those who need to replace medications. Lastly, graduate students with additional needs are &#x201C;encouraged to submit a request for <a href=\"https:\/\/financialaid.stanford.edu\/grad\/funding\/programs\/emergency.html\">Emergency Grant In Aid<\/a>.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article has been updated to reflect new information shared with the Stanford community on the power restoration

He focuses on the health impacts of climate change and the co-benefits of a sustainable and just energy transition.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, Stanford leadership has gestured toward an interest in environmental justice (EJ). This December, university leaders took an important step in launching the EJ Cluster Hire &#x2014; originally proposed by the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ejstanford.com\/\"> Stanford EJ Working Group<\/a> in 2018 and widely supported by the Stanford community. The goal is to fill a glaring gap: despite environmental justice being necessary to achieving a sustainable society, we have no environmental justice scholars on the Academic Council Stanford faculty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet through candidate interviews during campus visits (the EJ Working Group had no other role in the search), we learned that only one out of eleven interviewees self-identified as an environmental justice scholar. The vast majority of interviewees could not name an EJ scholar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We assert that this search cannot be constituted as the long-awaited &#x201C;EJ Cluster Hire.&#x201D; Further, we are highly concerned that Stanford appears willing to co-opt the words &#x201C;Environmental Justice&#x201D; without making a commitment to an established field of scholarship. To make this right, we need an intentional Environmental Justice cluster hire that is dedicated to expanding EJ expertise in the newly-minted Doerr School of Sustainability.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the spirit of repair, we have brought these concerns to new school leadership. During a sit-down interview with students a few weeks ago, Dean Arun Majumdar told us (on the record), &#x201C;You have my commitment that we will be looking at EJ, we will be hiring, and you will have the deep engagement that is necessary and the input from the EJ Working Group. That I can commit to.&#x201D;&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have heard similar statements before. We urge Dean Majumdar to reinvest in environmental justice as the foundation for true sustainability. Indeed, the Doerr School launch presents a unique opportunity to learn from Stanford&#x2019;s mistakes, create meaningful space for EJ and move us towards a just transition beyond fossil fuels. Can the Doerr School of Sustainability commit to visionary investments beyond big oil? Can the new school&#x2019;s leadership commit to investing in the knowledge and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ejstanford.com\/indigenous-leadership-in-the-emerging-green-economy.html\">expertise of frontline communities<\/a>?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This commitment is essential because achieving sustainability requires attending to the deep divisions and disparities that persist within and across societies. If we are not prioritizing environmental justice as a key framework that encourages research-to-action approaches that engage with the root causes of inequities and racialized oppression linked to environmental degradation, we will fail in our sustainability efforts. Yet with scholarly frameworks from EJ, our students gain the intellectual structures, research methodologies, and ethical understandings they need to avoid reproducing injustice when they go out into the world to &#x201C;solve&#x201D; sustainability problems that are deeply connected to ongoing histories of racialized discrimination, dispossession and injustice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>EJ scholarship extends beyond engaging with issues of inequality through policy or economic methods. Rather, it is an area of scholarship that centers the experiences, leadership and agency of frontline communities in research.<strong> <\/strong>According to this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teachingej.com\/about-us\/\">national EJ teaching and education database<\/a> coordinated by members of Stanford&#x2019;s Environmental Justice Working Group and additional partners, it &#x201C;is a framework at the nexus of social movements and research that centers the leadership and expertise of BIPOC [Black Indigenous People of Color] voices as it makes intersectional connections between painful histories of environmental racism and processes and practices of rebuilding a more equitable, healthy and safer world.&#x201D; As with other fields of research, EJ scholarship is rooted in a set of methodologies, literature and research traditions that are mutually recognized among EJ scholars and practitioners. These traditions have been established through the groundbreaking research of Robert Bullard, together with many others, as well as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ucc.org\/what-we-do\/justice-local-church-ministries\/justice\/faithful-action-ministries\/environmental-justice\/principles_of_environmental_justice\/\">EJ principles<\/a> set by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ucc.org\/30th-anniversary-the-first-national-people-of-color-environmental-leadership-summit\/\">First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While a true EJ cluster hire at Stanford would be a powerful step for our institution, Stanford will not be the first to attempt to fill this gap. We can look to President Biden&#x2019;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefing-room\/presidential-actions\/2021\/01\/20\/executive-order-protecting-public-health-and-environment-and-restoring-science-to-tackle-climate-crisis\/\">early directives<\/a> centering environmental justice and through the creation of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/environmentaljustice\/white-house-environmental-justice-advisory-council\">White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council<\/a>. We can even look to Stanford&#x2019;s peer institutions for guidance. Late last year, Berkeley <a href=\"https:\/\/www.diverseeducation.com\/faculty-staff\/article\/15114439\/new-cluster-hires-at-uc-berkeley-all-of-different-disciplines-will-focus-on-climate-equity\">successfully completed<\/a> its Climate Equity and Environmental Justice search, bringing on five scholars. Berkeley has also committed to cross-department cluster hires on issues relating to Native American and Indigenous People, Anti-Black Racism and Social Inclusion, Latinx and Democracy, Artificial Intelligence and Inequality and Understanding (Non) Citizenship. The new Yale School of the Environment <a href=\"https:\/\/environment.yale.edu\/news\/article\/dorceta-taylor-preeminent-environmental-justice-scholar-returns-to-yale\">recently hired<\/a> Dorceta Taylor, a preeminent EJ scholar; <a href=\"https:\/\/ycej.yale.edu\/en\/people\/gerald-torres\">Gerald Torres<\/a> is also a professor of Environmental Justice on Yale&#x2019;s faculty. Washington University St. Louis has an <a href=\"https:\/\/biology.wustl.edu\/news\/environmental-justice-cluster-three-assistant-professor-positions\">ongoing EJ-only<\/a> cluster hire, and the University of San Diego is also running a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sandiego.edu\/cas\/about\/diversity-equity-inclusion\/hiring.php\">cluster hire<\/a> with an EJ focus, among other institutions.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Moving forward, leadership should reinvest in a real, EJ-only cluster hire.<\/strong> This requires acknowledging that the recent cluster hire does not include environmental justice scholars. An EJ cluster hire cannot be EJ in name alone, but must reflect EJ values and be tailored specifically to EJ scholarship. Further, the hire would ideally follow best practices for diversity, equity and inclusion hires. Dean Majumdar need only engage directly with the students, staff and faculty who have been working to bring EJ to Stanford for years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we bring together diverse thinkers on campus to create the new school and to address complex problems like climate change &#x2014; known to create disproportionate levels of harm for historically marginalized communities &#x2014;&#xA0;we need EJ-centered leadership at the table in decision-making and policy-making. Lacking this, our leadership risks reproducing harm in the form of extractive research and policies that reinscribe disproportionate harm to historically marginalized communities of color.

caused a PG&amp;E system failure that sparked a campus-wide power outage in the early afternoon.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Stanford SU Alert system initially informed the community of the outage at 3:18 p.m., attributing the blackout to a problem with &#x201C;one of the main PG&amp;E transmission lines feeding campus.&#x201D;&nbsp;According to the alert, efforts are underway to transfer power to an alternate line. There was no estimation on when power would be restored, and warned students to prepare for chilled water curtailment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The outage comes on the hottest day of the year so far, with temperatures topping out at 102 degrees. Meanwhile, fires have been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/2022\/06\/21\/pair-of-san-mateo-county-grass-fires-force-evacuation-orders-near-redwood-city\/\">burning<\/a> through the surrounding areas in San Mateo County all day. The Edgewood Fire that reportedly caused the outage has not yet been contained as of Tuesday evening. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to PG&amp;E, the company&#8217;s &#8220;crews were immediately dispatched to the scene and are partnering with first responders as we work to safely restore power to approximately 8,900 customers.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are actively looking to connect impacted customers to other sections of our electric system to restore power as quickly as possible,&#8221; a PG&amp;E spokesperson wrote to The Daily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a follow-up message to the University community at 4:55 p.m., limited back-up power is in use and &#x201C;Level 4 chilled water curtailment is in effect, and efforts to restore cooling equipment for critical infrastructure are underway.&#x201D; The emergency effort means that chilled water will be conserved for hospital and animal safety when power is restored while most of building power will remain off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 6:26 p.m., the University notified the community that &#8220;flashlights are being distributed to student residences that do not have generator power, and are also available at the areas of respite (Arrillaga Family Dining Commons and EVGR Pavilion).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is still no restoration time estimation for the greater part of campus.

The International Swimming Federation (FINA) banned swimmers from Russia and Belarus from competing at the world championships because of the countries&#x2019; involvement in the ongoing war in Ukraine. &#x201C;FINA maintains its strongest condemnation of the Russian invasion of Ukraine,&#x201D; they <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fina.org\/news\/2547346\/press-release-fina-bureau-meets-makes-further-decisions-on-russian-and-belarusian-athletes-and-event-hosting\">wrote<\/a> in a March press release. Minakov placed fourth in the 100-meter butterfly at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. He remained in California this year and is currently training with Stanford.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gold for Huske<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the 2020 Olympics, Torri Huske finished fourth in the women&#x2019;s 100-meter butterfly with a time of 55.73 &#x2014; 0.01 seconds shy of a medal. She had a similar fate at the 2021 World Short Course Championships, taking fourth place in the event and narrowly missing out on a podium finish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Sunday, Huske broke this pattern to win her first 100 fly world title with a time of 55.64, a new record for American swimmers. Huske set the old record of 55.66 at the 2021 U.S. Olympic Trials. Her swim on Sunday was only 0.16 seconds off Sarah Sjostrom&#x2019;s current world record time of 55.48 seconds, making Huske the fourth-fastest woman in the history of the women&#x2019;s 100-meter butterfly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s really amazing, I don&#x2019;t really know how to put it into words because it&#x2019;s kind of surreal,&#x201D; Huske <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usaswimming.org\/news\/2022\/06\/19\/huske's-american-record-leads-u.s.'-trio-of-gold-medals\">said<\/a> to USA Swimming after the race. &#x201C;I feel like I haven&#x2019;t really processed it yet. I&#x2019;m just happy that I went a best time, more than anything, because at the end of the day I just want to see that I&#x2019;m improving.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With her win, Huske takes her second medal of this meet. On <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/19\/past-and-present-stanford-swimmers-earn-medals-on-first-day-of-world-championships\/\">Saturday<\/a>, she helped Team USA win bronze in the 4&#215;100 freestyle relay, leading off with a time of 52.96, which made her the third-fastest American woman in the history of the 100-meter freestyle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Smith and Curzan go 1-3<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smith finished first in the women&#x2019;s 100-meter backstroke on Monday. She recorded a time of 57.65 in the semifinal round on the previous day, earning the top qualifying spot for the final. Her time was 0.2 seconds short of Kaylee McKeown&#x2019;s world record.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smith was slightly slower in the finals, clocking&#xA0;a 58.22. However, it was still fast enough to clinch gold by 0.18 seconds.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I always kind of have [the world record] in the back of my mind and I was really pleased with my swim [on Sunday] being super close to it and really close to my best time,&#x201D; Smith <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usaswimming.org\/news\/2022\/06\/21\/u.s.-collects-another-six-medal-haul-in-budapest\">told<\/a> USA Swimming after her win. &#x201C;Of course I am a little bit bummed with my swim tonight, but again, tonight&#x2019;s about place, it&#x2019;s not about time, so I am really pleased overall.&#x201D; Smith&#x2019;s win marks her first major international title in the 100-meter backstroke.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finishing behind Smith was Curzan, who touched the wall third with a time of 58.67. Curzan claimed bronze in her first podium finish at a major international meet.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I have looked up to [Smith] for as long as I can remember, and she has been a backstroke icon for so long so it&#x2019;s kind of crazy for me to think about,&#x201D; Curzan <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usaswimming.org\/news\/2022\/06\/21\/u.s.-collects-another-six-medal-haul-in-budapest\">said<\/a> to USA Swimming of her USA and future Stanford teammate, Smith.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Curzan previously finished fifth in the women&#x2019;s 100-meter butterfly with a time of 56.74, and <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/19\/past-and-present-stanford-swimmers-earn-medals-on-first-day-of-world-championships\/\">recorded<\/a> a split of 52.71 to help Team USA earn bronze in the 4&#215;100 freestyle relay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ledecky Dominates<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie Ledecky won the women&#x2019;s 1500-meter freestyle with a time of 15:30.15, finishing a staggering 14.14 seconds ahead of her competition. Ledecky&#x2019;s swim was the sixth fastest performance in the event&#x2019;s history, trailing behind five of her other performances. This win adds onto her near-decade long dominance in this event. She previously won the World title for the 1500-meter freestyle at the 2013, 2015 and 2017 championship meets. She withdrew from the 2019 championships due to illness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With 13 individual world championship titles, Ledecky is now just two wins shy of tying Michael Phelps for most individual world titles in the history of the meet. Ledecky also <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/19\/past-and-present-stanford-swimmers-earn-medals-on-first-day-of-world-championships\/\">won<\/a> the 400-meter freestyle on Saturday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Other Stanford Contributors<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taylor Ruck &#x2019;22 competed in the 100-meter backstroke on Sunday for Canada and did not advance to the semi-finals. She placed 17th in the preliminary heats with a time of 1:01.14.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She bounced back on Monday, finishing sixth in the 200-meter freestyle semifinals with a time of 1:56.80 and securing a spot in the finals.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After three days of competition, Cardinal-affiliated swimmers have added three golds and a silver to their growing medal count.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1003325,"featured_media":1205800,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[645,23,45418,646],"tags":[78251,74737,78241,20618,27309,74699,35626,901,78250,687,16541,71346],"site-layouts":[77066],"coauthors":[78244],"parsely":{"version":"1.1.0","meta":{"@context":"https:\/\/schema.org","@type":"NewsArticle","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/21\/cardinal-women-make-a-splash-amid-2022-world-championships\/"},"headline":"Cardinal women make a splash amid 2022 World Championships","url":"http:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/21\/cardinal-women-make-a-splash-amid-2022-world-championships\/","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Regan-Smith_KAH_012122_054.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Regan-Smith_KAH_012122_054.jpg"},"dateCreated":"2022-06-21T21:38:43Z","datePublished":"2022-06-21T21:38:43Z","dateModified":"2022-06-21T21:38:49Z","articleSection":"Men's Swimming &amp;

season ends after two losses in College World Series"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>No. 2 Stanford (47-18, 21-9 Pac-12) was eliminated from the College World Series (CWS) after losing its first two games in Omaha. After being seen as one of the favorites to win heading into the tournament, the early elimination comes as a disappointment to the team and fans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first game of the CWS, Stanford faced the Arkansas Razorbacks (44-19, 18-12 SEC). The Cardinal defeated Arkansas earlier in the season 5-0, but the Razorbacks were on a hot streak before entering the CWS, defeating two top-ten teams to make the field.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stanford head coach David Esquer decided to start senior Alex Williams on the mound, while Connor Noland started for the Razorbacks. Williams struggled in his first two postseason starts, recording a 16.50 ERA. Meanwhile, Noland had turned in several excellent pitching performances in the postseason up to that point, possessing a 2.57 ERA through two starts.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the very first at-bat of the game, Arkansas lead-off hitter Braydon Webb hit a fly ball to the right field warning track, where freshman outfielder Braden Montgomery was located. However, Montgomery had trouble seeing through the sun, which resulted in the ball bouncing off the wall. Because of Montgomery&#x2019;s mishap, Webb was able to reach third base. Then, Brady Slavens hit a fly ball to left field that plated Webb and gave the Hogs a 1-0 lead heading into the bottom of the first.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Stanford&#x2019;s lead-off man also had an important hit of his own, as junior centerfielder Brock Jones hit a solo home run to tie the game at one apiece. The game remained 1-1 the next three innings, even as both teams had multiple opportunities to score with runners on base.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arkansas broke the stalemate in the fifth inning when Chris Lanzili hit a three-run home run to left field to put the Razorbacks back in the lead 4-1. After giving up another hit, Williams was replaced by sophomore left handed pitcher Ryan Bruno. Like Williams, Bruno also struggled against this Arkansas lineup, as he gave up a walk, a run by wild pitch and an RBI single before getting out of the fifth inning.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was the turning point in the game, as Arkansas continued to pile on runs throughout the later innings. The Hogs scored three runs in the seventh inning, two runs in the eighth and six runs in the ninth. Meanwhile, Stanford struggled to find hits against Noland and the Razorbacks&#x2019; terrific infield defense.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After Noland came out of the game in the eighth inning, junior second baseman Brett Barrera doubled to right field to plate the Cardinal&#x2019;s first run since the first inning. However, Stanford was not able to continue the rally and the Razorbacks&#x2019; deficit was too much for Stanford to overcome. Arkansas won 17-2 and set the overall record for hits in TD Ameritrade Park.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the game, Esquer credited Arkansas for their preparation against his team and maintained hope that the teams would rematch: &#x201C;They did a good job of preparing for us and pitching to that preparation. Hopefully, we&#x2019;ll get a chance to see them again, and we&#x2019;ll see what happens in the rubber match between Stanford and Arkansas.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After losing to Arkansas, Stanford played against No. 14 Auburn (42-21, 16-13 SEC) in the loser&#x2019;s bracket. The Tigers had lost to Ole Miss 5-1 in their first game of the CWS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Stanford&#x2019;s first game of the CWS, Jones got a lead-off hit, dribbling a single through the right side of the infield. After first baseman Carter Graham struck out, Jones stole second base to put a runner in scoring position for Stanford. The steal eventually paid off, as Barrera hit a double to plate Jones and give Stanford an early lead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the first inning, Stanford put another run on board in the second inning when junior shortstop Adam Crampton hit a ball down the third base line with sophomore DH Tommy Troy in scoring position. This extended Stanford&#x2019;s lead to 2-0 and gave the Cardinal early momentum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other side, Auburn&#x2019;s offense was putting runners on base during several early innings, but failed to capitalize on the opportunities to bring these runners home. Additionally, the pitchers for both teams began to settle in after a couple of innings, which led to three scoreless innings between the two teams.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After sophomore starting pitcher Drew Dowd gave up a walk and a double in consecutive at-bats during the fifth, junior pitcher Quinn Matthews came in to relieve Dowd. Matthews got out of the fifth inning jam without giving up any runs, but his luck soon ran out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the top of the sixth, after getting the lead-off man out, Matthews gave up a single and double in consecutive at-bats to put runners on third and second. After striking out the next batter, Matthews issued two straight walks and gave Auburn its first run. After striking out the succeeding batter, Matthews hung a changeup in the strike zone that was barreled by Cole Foster. The ball hit off the centerfield wall, and all the runners on base scored to give Auburn its first lead of the game, 4-2.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the game, Auburn senior outfielder Kason Howell discussed the significance of Foster&#x2019;s hit: &#x201C;It was huge. We lost a lot of 3-2 counts and we were battling. Offensively, we haven&#x2019;t been where we wanted the last couple of games. Cole really put a spark into our offense. You could tell, everyone&#x2019;s at-bats were a little bit more on the attack after Cole&#x2019;s big swing.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even after his struggles in the sixth inning, Matthews stayed in the game during the seventh. He got into trouble early in the inning, as he gave up a walk and a double to put runners on first and third with no outs. Auburn&#x2019;s Brody Moore subsequently hit a fly out to left field to score another run. Then Sonny Dichiara struck out, which gave Stanford a chance to get out of the inning with limited damage. However, Matthews did not take advantage, as Bobby Peirce hit a double to left center to give the Tigers an extra insurance run and a 6-2 lead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cardinal did not lay down yet, putting up a rally in the bottom of the seventh with two outs. First, Crampton hammered a double to left center, Jones got hit by a pitch and Graham hit a single to load the bases. It was a prime position for the Cardinal to score since Barrera, the Pac-12 batting champion, was hitting next. But after battling to make it a full count, Barrera struck out. This devastating strike out effectively dashed Stanford&#x2019;s chances of making a comeback.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, the Tigers defeated the Cardinal 6-2 to avoid elimination but ended Stanford&#x2019;s illustrious season. While the early exit from Omaha may be a disappointment, the team achieved peaks the program had not seen in a long time. These include winning the Pac-12 regular season championship for the first time since 2018 and being crowned the inaugural Pac-12 Tournament champions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking ahead, it remains to be seen which members of the team will declare for the MLB Draft. Important players like Jones, Barrera and Matthews can elect to come back another year, and their decisions will be vital for the prospects of the team in 2023. Currently, Jones is projected to be a first round pick, while both Barrera and Matthews will likely be drafted in the tenth round or later.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Stanford also has a lot of key pieces returning, including Pac-12 freshman of the Year Montgomery and the Pac-12 home run leader Graham. In addition to those two, left fielder Eddie Park, third baseman Drew Bowser and Troy will return to the Farm. While the pieces guaranteed to come back will likely slot Stanford in the Top 25 rankings, returning key draft-eligible players could boost the Cardinal to a preseason Top 5 ranking.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the end, the Tigers defeated the Cardinal 6-2 to avoid elimination but ended Stanford\u2019s illustrious season.

first program, Long Beach State, was established in 2012. He was also integral in starting USC&#x2019;s program, which has since developed into a national powerhouse. So when Fuller made his way back to the Bay Area before the 2017 season to coach Stanford beach volleyball, which was still in its infancy, expectations were high. And build the Stanford program he did: with two straight NCAA Championship tournament appearances under their belt, the Cardinal have only been improving each year and could soon make their way into conversations about being the best program in the nation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the program&#x2019;s tenth year, the Cardinal won 24 games &#x2014; improving on last year&#x2019;s single-season record for games won &#x2014; and qualified for their second straight NCAA tournament in 2022. Although the team did not win a game in the tournament, qualifying for the second consecutive year was an accomplishment itself, especially given that the team is the newest at Stanford.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The list of individual accomplishments is long as well: sophomores Kate Reilly and Maya Harvey set a single-season record for most individual games won; Reilly and sophomore Xolani Hodel set a record for most career wins as a pair; and the Cardinal tied their program record for most postseason conference honorees with five. Reilly said that though expectations may have been higher this season, &#x201C;I thought we could have done a little more, but overall, looking back on it, I think we have a lot of work to be proud of.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;In the grand scope of things, I&#x2019;d say we had a more successful season than we&#x2019;ve probably ever had before,&#x201D; senior Charlie Ekstrom added. &#x201C;I think that it ended on a little bit more sour of a note than we might have wanted just because of the fact that we&#8217;ve gotten kind of that taste of being at the very, very top of competition.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps even more impressive than the Cardinal&#8217;s success in the 2022 season is the fact that the their 2021 season was so successful, as well. After the majority of the 2020 season was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the beach volleyball players were scattered around the United States with no team to train with. The Stanford athletes returned to campus in 2021, just in time for a three-week preseason. The team&#8217;s preseason is normally 16 weeks &#x2014; so not only were the Cardinal athletes coming back from nearly a year of training alone, but they were also expected to jump back into competition with less than 20% of their normal preseason.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Our teams did an amazing job of preparing on their own to be ready for the season,&#x201D; Fuller said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s really a testament to their work ethic and determination to be ready on their own without any real coaching from the Stanford staff.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While team practices didn&#x2019;t resume until the spring of 2021, Reilly, who is from Manhattan Beach, Calif., said many of her teammates were also staying in Southern California and sometimes met up to train together. Despite the distance leading up to the 2021 season, the team came together to set a school record for total wins in a single season with 23 and qualify for its first-ever NCAA Championship tournament.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fuller attributes a large part of the team&#8217;s recent success, especially over the last two years, to recruiting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been fortunate to be involved with the national team system, that program, for a long time and been able to just be around the highest levels of the junior game,&#x201D; Fuller explained. Six athletes currently on Stanford&#x2019;s roster have been affiliated with the USA Volleyball development programs or the National Team at some point before coming to the Farm, according to roster information available on <a href=\"https:\/\/gostanford.com\/sports\/womens-beach-volleyball\/roster\">GoStanford<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ekstrom said that the number of athletes on the team has grown significantly since her first year in 2018, and while talent has also grown, the fact that the team does not rely on indoor volleyball players to play beach volleyball in the spring has made a significant difference.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Ekstrom first came to Stanford, the team included 10 beach-only athletes during the season, and three indoor volleyball players to round out the lineup &#x2014; but by the end of the season, the team only had 10 healthy players between beach-only athletes and the ones who also played indoor volleyball in the fall. Now, the team has 18 players, all of whom only play beach volleyball.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;For the first time ever, we had more than one person not traveling,&#x201D; Ekstrom said. &#x201C;The depth of our team has just grown so exponentially over the last four years. It&#x2019;s jaw-dropping actually looking back on it.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reilly said that as the team&#x2019;s depth has increased and the program has become more well-established, team culture has shifted. She said there is now &#x201C;more buy-in and we&#x2019;re trying to push each other to get better and better.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a four-year starter and two-time All-American, Ekstrom has played a significant role in shifting team culture. The team had a losing record in her first season in 2019, as it struggled with depth and keeping enough players healthy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;We were unranked at the end of my freshman year, and we didn&#x2019;t come in unranked, but it was a tough season,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;It was one of those rude awakenings.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I know my class,&#x201D; she added. &#x201C;When we met before the season started, we were so excited to get back to campus to be with everybody just because of the fact that we were so excited to be as bought-in as we were and to work to inspire and work with the underclassmen.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Increased team buy-in has made Fuller&#x2019;s job as head coach easier as well. He described his coaching philosophy as &#x201C;let&#8217;s see what we have and then try and support it and maximize it.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But despite all the things that have gone well for Stanford over the last several seasons, each year has not been without significant challenges. The beach volleyball team has not been immune to the mental health challenges that countless athletes have faced. Fuller said the most challenging thing that he has faced at Stanford, outside of the difficulties of recruiting, has been Stanford&#x2019;s culture of &#x201C;doing too much,&#x201D; which can negatively impact his athletes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an effort to combat the overwhelmingness that can easily characterize daily life on the Farm, Fuller brought in Professor Fred Luskin to speak with the team every Tuesday throughout the 2022 season. Luskin is a lecturer at the Stanford Prevention Research Center and the director of the Stanford Forgiveness Project. He regularly gives talks on the importance of emotional intelligence and managing stress.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Luskin is not a medical professional, such as the psychiatrists that students can see at CAPS or Stanford Sports Psychology, Ekstrom said that through activities like guided meditation, Luskin helped the team &#x201C;put things in perspective.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;He was giving us really solid perspectives, or really solid opportunities to find happiness or find serenity or find joy in very, very little tangible things,&#x201D; she continued. &#x201C;It was more of shifting the framework of your mind into great gratitude or appreciation.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reilly summed it up by saying &#x201C;[Luskin] was pretty big&#x201D; and that the mood for Tuesday&#x2019;s practice was always different, in a positive way. She said her teammates were &#x201C;more willing to let go of results or be less self-critical&#x201D; and that his discussions always brought the team closer together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team will now turn its attention to building on the positives from this season, as the relatively young team goes into next season with another year of NCAA tournament experience under its belt and three seniors &#x2014; Ekstrom, Maddie Dailey and Jordan McKinney &#x2014; planning to return to complete co-terminal master&#x2019;s degrees next year. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fuller said this year&#x2019;s team was around 50-60% underclassmen, as 12 of 18 athletes on the roster were in their first or second year in 2022, according to the roster on GoStanford. Fuller, Ekstrom and Reilly also all pointed out that the beach volleyball program is bringing in a phenomenal recruiting class next year, highlighted by players like Ashley Vincent, Line Andersson and Kelly Berardi.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the team&#x2019;s goals, the Cardinal have progressed from aiming to qualify for the NCAA Championship to hoping to win games at the tournament and bring a national title back to the Farm &#x2014; a testament to the enormous amounts of growth the team has experienced over the last several years. Reilly also said the only two Pac-12 schools that Stanford has not yet beaten are UCLA and USC, two powerhouse programs from Southern California that have a combined six Pac-12 Championship titles, six national championship title game appearances and six national titles between them. She said another one of the Cardinal&#x2019;s goals is to defeat those programs. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, the athletes have the summer to continue training and will kick off their season eight months from now, in February 2023.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I think this is just the beginning,&#x201D; Fuller said. &#x201C;We&#8217;re nowhere near how good we&#8217;re going to be.&#x201D;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With two straight NCAA Championship tournament appearances under their belt, the Cardinal have only been improving each year and could

He expressed concern that, given the lack of open discussion about harassment within the DLCL, graduate students were left in the dark, rumors and hearsay thrived and the entire community was corroded by distrust.&#xA0;<\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p>&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t have education where there&#x2019;s not trust, period,&#x201D; Palumbo-Liu said. In his view, the only way to address this culture is by cultivating conversations within the community &#x2014; not just relying on legal processes and disciplinary frameworks like Title IX, which may not always apply to the conduct at hand.<\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p>Prior to the Title IX investigation, Rachel said she sought institutional support from some faculty and administrators.

all over the world flocked to Budapest for the swimming portion of the 2022 FINA World Aquatics Championships, which began on Saturday. Current, former and future members of Stanford women&#x2019;s swimming combined to claim four medals &#x2014; one gold, one silver and two bronzes &#x2014; to close out a successful opening day of competition for the Cardinal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ledecky cements her legacy<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many viewers, the biggest question surrounding the women&#x2019;s 400-meter freestyle final on Saturday night was whether or not Katie Ledecky &#x2019;20 could break Australian swimmer Ariarne Titmus&#x2019;s world record of 3:56.40. This May, Titmus took down Ledecky&#x2019;s six-year-old world record of 3:56.46 at the 2022 Australian Championships. Previously, Titmus beat out Ledecky for gold in this event at both the 2019 World Championships and the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Titmus bypassing the World Championships to prioritize the Commonwealth Games later this summer, Ledecky had an opportunity to reclaim her World title in the event. Although she was less than two seconds shy of the world record, Ledecky won gold with 3:58.15.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;It feels good. It&#x2019;s the fastest I&#x2019;ve ever been at Worlds so I&#x2019;m really happy with that,&#x201D; Ledecky <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usaswimming.org\/news\/2022\/06\/18\/u.s.-kicks-off-finabudapest-with-six-medals\">told USA Swimming<\/a> following the race. &#x201C;I am really excited about the rest of the week I have ahead of me.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The win marks Ledecky&#x2019;s fourth world title in the 400-meter freestyle and her 12th individual world title overall. The former Cardinal&#x2019;s gold on Saturday makes her the second-most decorated swimmer in terms of individual world titles, only behind&nbsp; Michael Phelps and his 15 individual World Championship golds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Huske and Curzan step up for Team USA<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite no previous experience in sprint freestyle on the senior international stage, rising sophomore Torri Huske and incoming freshman Claire Curzan were slated to swim the 4&#215;100-meter freestyle relay after their 1-2 finish in the 100-meter freestyle in the U.S. World Championships Trials this year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Huske led Team USA off with a time of 52.96, &#x2014; a new personal best. Curzan, who went last, split 52.71. The pair&#x2019;s efforts, alongside teammates Kate Douglass and Erika Brown, helped Team USA to a bronze medal in the event, with Canada taking silver and Australia taking gold.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;It feels great,&#x201D; Curzan <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usaswimming.org\/news\/2022\/06\/18\/u.s.-kicks-off-finabudapest-with-six-medals\">said<\/a> to USA Swimming after the relay. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a super exciting relay to be a part of and it&#x2019;s great to just knock the first one out and get a medal with it.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ruck bounces back<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, Canadian swimmer Taylor Ruck &#x2019;22 was considered by many to be the next big star in swimming after earning titles in the Commonwealth Games and Pan Pacific Championships. Late last year Ruck spoke out about her struggles with an eating disorder that has affected her career and contributed to a decline in her performances. The Globe and Mail <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theglobeandmail.com\/canada\/article-canadian-olympians-athletes-eating-disorder-problem-amateur-sports\/\">reported<\/a> that she saw improvements in her performance after seeking treatment last year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Saturday, she clocked a split of 52.92 to help Team Canada win silver in the 4&#215;100-meter freestyle relay alongside Penny Oleksiak, Maggie MacNeil and Kayla Sanchez. It was Ruck&#x2019;s fastest 100-meter freestyle relay split since she recorded a time of&nbsp; 51.82 seconds in 2018.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#x2019;t Ruck&#x2019;s first success this year. At the 2022 NCAA Championships, Ruck won her first-ever NCAA individual title in the 200-yard freestyle in a time of 1:41.12, her fastest since the 2018-19 season.

While this year&#x2019;s Cup season is not technically complete &#x2014; No. 2 Stanford men&#x2019;s baseball (47-16, 21-9 Pac-12) and No. 9 Texas (47-20, 14-10 Big 12) will both take the field this week in the College World Series &#x2014; the National Association of Collegiate Directors of America (NACDA) <a href=\"https:\/\/nacda.com\/news\/2022\/6\/16\/directorscup-tufts-grand-valley-and-texas-secure-learfield-directors-cups.aspx\">announced Thursday<\/a> morning that the competition was effectively over.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Longhorns, who broke the Cardinal&#x2019;s legendary <a href=\"https:\/\/www.si.com\/college\/texas\/news\/texas-clinches-directors-cup-for-2nd-year-in-a-row-amid-run-of-success-in-spring\">25-year grip on<\/a> the Cup last year, had an impressive season across a variety of sports on their way to claiming four NCAA titles and their second Directors&#x2019; Cup in a row.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Directors&#x2019; Cup is presented to the athletic program with the best results in a given year&#x2019;s national championship competition. It was first awarded for the 1993-1994 season; Stanford claimed its first Cup the following year and held the cup for the next quarter century until Texas broke the spell last year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though Stanford boasts 36 Division I programs &#x2014; twice the number of the Longhorns &#x2014; only a maximum of 19 sports may count towards the result. As per the official rules specified in a NACDA <a href=\"https:\/\/nacda.com\/documents\/2022\/6\/15\/June16DI.docx\">press release<\/a> on Thursday, these teams must include women&#x2019;s volleyball and basketball, as well as men&#x2019;s basketball and baseball. This leaves 15 scoring places, which are ultimately filled by the next best-performing teams at each school, discounting gender.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Texas&#x2019; strong all-around performance in national competition gave the Longhorns an edge over Stanford in the overall tabulation. The Longhorns&#x2019; <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/05\/29\/womens-rowing-finishes-second-at-ncaa-championship\/\">women&#x2019;s rowing<\/a> and tennis teams successfully defended their National Championship titles from 2021, and men&#x2019;s golf and indoor track and field scored two further championships. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.si.com\/college\/texas\/news\/texas-clinches-directors-cup-for-2nd-year-in-a-row-amid-run-of-success-in-spring\">Of their 18<\/a> Division I athletic programs, a staggering 10 either won or finished runner-up in NCAA Championship competition this season, with Texas earning national runner-up results in softball, women&#x2019;s indoor track and field, men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s outdoor track and field and men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s swimming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stanford has won at least one National Championship every year for the past 46 years &#x2014;&nbsp;a streak that was kept alive during the 2021-22 season with three national crowns for the Cardinal. Stanford&#8217;s first win of the season came from a dominant performance by <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/04\/17\/mens-gymnastics-earns-third-straight-national-championship\/\">men&#x2019;s gymnastics<\/a>, which outpaced the competition to win its third straight title. Next, sixth-year driver Makenzie Fischer led <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/05\/08\/womens-water-polo-defeats-usc-to-earn-eighth-ncaa-title\/\">women&#x2019;s water polo<\/a> to its eighth NCAA title. And to give the Cardinal their third title of the year, freshman <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/05\/23\/zhang-wins-ncaa-title-womens-golf-claims-top-seed\/\">Rose Zhang<\/a> not only won an individual national title but helped <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/05\/25\/cardinal-dominance-womens-golf-wins-second-ncaa-championship\/\">women&#x2019;s golf<\/a> on its path to winning the team&#x2019;s second-ever NCAA championship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Cardinal managed to better their own total from last year, there are no longer enough points left in the competition for them to overtake Texas. <a href=\"https:\/\/nacda.com\/news\/2022\/6\/16\/directorscup-tufts-grand-valley-and-texas-secure-learfield-directors-cups.aspx\">As of Thursday<\/a>, the Longhorns had accumulated 1376.50 points and Stanford sat nearly 100 points back with 1279.25 overall. With back-to-back Directors&#x2019; Cup victories, Texas has firmly announced its arrival on the scene and made clear its intentions to stay.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For the second consecutive year, Stanford has finished runner-up to Texas in the Directors&#8217; Cup.

Based on this feedback, next year, they will be rolling out a brand new housing system that simultaneously addresses the inefficiencies of the current system and solves one of the most pressing problems plaguing Stanford students of all class years &#x2014; the Stanford dating scene.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike this quarter, where students are assigned a time slot to select their residence and room assignment, next year, students will instead return to ranking their housing preferences within their neighborhoods. In addition, students will now also be required to rank classmates they find attractive.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;We found that students rarely have spare time to devote to finding a significant other because of their already time-intensive commitments to academics, extracurriculars, friends, and sleep, so we wanted to implement a system that would make finding a partner as convenient as possible. When assigning housing, the system will consider both the housing rankings and the classmate rankings and attempt to put classmates who find each other attractive in the same residence to give students more opportunities during their busy schedules to find a partner during the academic year,&#8221; and R&amp;DE representative said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To facilitate this new focus on the dating scene at Stanford, R&amp;DE will also be rolling out a stipend program for students to take each other out on dates off campus, instead of at dining halls. The application-based program will be called &#x201C;SINGL,&#x201D; which stands for &#x201C;Stipend Intended for Not Getting Lonely.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;The new housing assignment system and SINGL are just some of the many innovative new systems and programs we plan on pioneering next year. We are also currently working on an initiative that will address students&#x2019; desires to save money by cooking for themselves,&#8221; an R&amp;DE financial representative explained. &#8220;We have received many emails about allowing students to have stoves in EVGR-A residences, for example, so we&#x2019;ve decided to open up a brand-new stove hub right next to EVGR-A. Students will be able to rent a stove by the hour at the hub, at the low price of just $89.99 per hour!&#x201D; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>R&amp;DE is excited to launch these various programs in the upcoming school year, and the University hopes that these feedback-based changes will help enrich students&#x2019; lives and help them to thrive in all aspects of their lives at Stanford.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article is purely satirical and fictitious.

defeats UConn in Super Regional, advances to College World Series"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Over the weekend, No. 2 Stanford baseball (47-16, 21-9 Pac-12) defeated UConn (50-15, 16-5 Big East) in a best-of-three series to advance to the College World Series. The Cardinal dropped the first contest of the series in thrilling fashion before coming back to win the final two games to punch their ticket to Omaha, Neb. This marks Stanford&#x2019;s 18th appearance in the College World Series, which ties Arizona for fifth all-time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the series began, Stanford head coach David Esquer knew that beating the unranked Huskies squad would be a difficult task. &#x201C;With sixteen teams remaining, there are no soft weekends,&#8221; he said. &#8220;All sixteen teams are capable.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first game of the series, Esquer started senior Alex Williams on the mound. In the top of the first inning, Williams struck out the lead-off hitter and made the two-hole hitter fly out to center field to give the Cardinal two quick outs. But after Williams forced three-hole hitter Casey Dana to fly the ball to left field, sophomore left fielder Eddie Park dropped the ball, which allowed Dana to make it to second base. Promptly following this error, UConn Ben Huber hit a double to plate Dana and give the Huskies a 1-0 lead.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following his defensive mishap, Park redeemed himself in the same inning by making a leaping catch to steal a home run from UConn shortstop Bryan Padilla. This catch got the Cardinal out of the inning with limited damage. But it could not slow down UConn in the long run, as the Huskies went on a hitting streak in the top of the second.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Williams gave up six base hits, including three doubles and a home run in the second inning alone. After UConn extended its lead to 6-0, junior pitcher Max Meier replaced Williams. But Meier could not limit the Huskies&#x2019; damage either, as he gave up three more runs to make the game 9-0.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Stanford did not lay down after trailing by a seemingly insurmountable margin. Sophomore third baseman Drew Bowser hit a two-run home run in the second inning to cut the lead to 9-2. Soon after, junior right fielder Brock Jones hit a two-run shot to center field to further cut into the lead. Nonetheless, UConn gained these runs back by scoring two runs in the fourth and two more in the seventh.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the bottom of the seventh, two solo homers off the bats of Jones and junior second baseman Brett Barrera cut the UConn lead to 13-6. But the Cardinal offense did not stop there.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the bottom of the ninth, Jones hit a two-run shot &#x2014; his third home run of the game &#x2014;&#xA0;to put the Cardinal within five runs. Then, freshman right fielder Braden Montgomery followed with a two-run home run to make the score 13-10. Both Bowser and sophomore DH Tommy Troy hit solo big slams to make it a one-run ball game. However, after Park drew a base on balls, shortstop Adam Crampton struck out swinging, which clinched the game for UConn 13-12.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a reversal of game one, Stanford&#x2019;s bats got out to a fast start in the first two innings of game two. In the top of the first, junior catcher Kody Huff hit a single up the middle to score Barrera and Graham.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After UConn put up one run in the bottom of the first, Stanford went on a six-run rally in the second inning. First, Jones hit a sacrifice fly to center field to plate Park. Then, Graham hit a bloop single to right field, which scored Crampton. After Barrera singled, Montgomery hit a towering shot to left center to extend the lead to 7-1. To cap off the inning, Bowser hit a solo home run to make the score 8-1.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>UConn scored one more run in the bottom of the second inning, which was the last run of the game, as Stanford&#x2019;s bullpen did not let UConn climb back into the game. In the end, Stanford took game two 8-2 to keep its College World Series hopes alive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the decisive third game, UConn got off to another quick start in the first inning. After sophomore pitcher Joey Dixon loaded the bases, UConn&#x2019;s Ben Huber hit a double that brought all three runners on the base paths home. After Huber&#x2019;s double, sophomore pitcher Drew Dowd came in to pitch for Huber.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Huber on second, Padilla hit a double to put runners on third and second with no outs. After Padilla&#x2019;s AB, Dowd got a pop fly in the infield to get the first out of the inning, but walked the next batter to load the bases with just one out. With the count at 1-0, Dowd placed an off-speed pitch outside the plate, which the UConn batter hit directly to Adam Crampton. Crampton tossed the ball to second baseman Brett Barrera, who then immediately threw it to Carter Graham to complete the double play and limit the damage in the inning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Stanford offensively, Jones led off the bottom of the first with a single that turned into two bases after an error by the UConn outfielder. After flyouts to the outfield, Jones scored to make the score 3-1. After Jones scored, Montgomery drew a walk and then Huff hit a double, which plated Montgomery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After two scoreless innings, Stanford put up a six-run rally in the fourth inning to break the game open. To get it started, Park and Troy hit singles to put runners on first and second with no outs. After a muffed pick-off attempt, Park and Troy advanced to second and third, respectively. Then, the ninth-hole hitter, Crampton, hit a single up the middle to bring home Park and Troy. Later in the inning, the Cardinal loaded the bases with Huff up to bat. After battling to make it a 2-1 count, Huff hit a shot to left field for a grand slam, making the score 8-3.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While UConn scored in both the sixth and ninth innings, the pitching combination of sophomore Ryan Bruno and junior Quinn Matthews limited the potent UConn offense to just two scores and helped Stanford clinch the win &#x2014;&#xA0;and a trip to Omaha.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking forward, Stanford will face off against Arkansas first in the College World Series. The Cardinal defeated Arkansas earlier this year 5-0 in the Round Rock Classic, but the Razorbacks have been on a hot streak as of late, defeating two top-ten teams to make it to Omaha. First pitch is scheduled for 11 a.m. PT on Saturday, June 18 and will be televised on ESPN.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This weekend, No. 2 Stanford baseball came from behind

Mutsun, organizers call on Stanford community to support Protect Juristac movement"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p><em>This article is the second in a two-part series about Protect Juristac, a years-long campaign led by the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band to stop sand and gravel mining on their sacred grounds. The <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/15\/protect-juristac-the-movement-to-protect-a-local-tribes-most-sacred-site\/\">previous article<\/a> provides more background on the movement.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers with the Protect Juristac movement are calling on the Stanford community to support their efforts to halt the Sargent Quarry project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project&#x2019;s <a href=\"https:\/\/plandev.sccgov.org\/policies-programs\/smara\/sargent\">proposal<\/a>, which includes 30 years of a sand and gravel mining project at Sargent Ranch, was submitted to the Santa Clara County Department of Planning and Development in 2015 by the Debt Acquisition Company of America (DACA). The project&#8217;s start date is dependent on the county approval process, which has faced several delays. To the Amah Mutsun, a local landless tribe without federal recognition, Sargent Ranch is known as Juristac and marks the site of the tribe&#x2019;s Big Head ceremonies. According to Chairman Valentin Lopez of the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band, these are the tribe&#8217;s most important ceremonies and serve a range of purposes, from healing to maintaining balance with the four seasons.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juristac is located in Gilroy, about an hour south of Stanford. Given the University&#x2019;s role in the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2017\/01\/23\/before-stanford-the-muwekma-ohlone-people\/\">dispossession of Indigenous people<\/a>, organizers told The Daily that it is especially important for community members to learn about and support Indigenous advocacy in the region.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>County law currently allows for the proposed destruction of Juristac, according to Lopez. He emphasized that overwhelming public support is necessary to stop the mining at Juristac.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DACA did not respond to The Daily&#8217;s request for comment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"http:\/\/www.protectjuristac.org\/petition\/\">petition<\/a> on the Protect Juristac website calling on the county to protect Amah Mutsun sacred grounds from the proposed quarry has received 15,046 signatures as of June 12.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lopez said that when people sign the petition, they can check a box to receive updates regarding Juristac and opportunities to attend public meetings. &#x201C;When the public meetings are called, we ask people to show up to show their support for the Amah Mutsun and our land,&#x201D; he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Protect Juristac website shares several ways for community members to get involved in the movement, including writing letters to the County Board of Supervisors and the Santa Clara County Planning Commission to voice opposition to the mining project. &#x201C;Indigenous sites have been destroyed for money and profit by greedy developers, and we ask that people stand with us,&#x201D; Lopez said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Michelle Glowa, an assistant professor of anthropology and social change at the California Institute of Integral Studies, said that if the Sargent Quarry project is allowed to move forward, damage to the site will be substantial. A Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) outlining the potential cultural and environmental impacts of the mining project is expected to be released later this year. Upon its release, a 60-day public comment period will begin, and Glowa encouraged individuals to get involved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked about the long-term consequences of the project, Robert Salisbury, Senior Planner at the Santa Clara County Department of Planning and Development, said: &#x201C;The County is still evaluating the [Sargent Quarry project] and impacts under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).&#x201D; Salisbury confirmed that the DEIR is slated to be published in the summer or fall of this year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, the actual release date of the DEIR remains unclear: the DEIR has experienced numerous delays and was initially expected to be released <a href=\"http:\/\/www.protectjuristac.org\/updates\/upcoming-events-in-october\/\">over two and a half years ago<\/a>. When the DEIR is released, however, it will provide another opportunity for the movement to showcase its support, according to supporters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;This is really the time for people to be able to stand up and say &#x2018;We believe these impacts are too great,&#x201D; Glowa said. &#x201C;We believe that it is not worth it to sacrifice the most important, sacred spiritual site of the Amah Mutsun for some gravel and sand. The consequences are too severe.&#x2019;&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Echoing Glowa, Lopez hopes that the general public will put renewed pressure on the county&#8217;s decision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;For those of you who have relevant expertise &#x2014; studied hydrology, wildlife, protections, etc. &#x2014; write detailed technical responses to the report,&#x201D; Lopez urged. &#8220;Tell the county to deny the permit because of the negative impacts it will have on Juristac.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Representatives from the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.biologicaldiversity.org\/\">Center for Biological Diversity<\/a> and the law firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smwlaw.com\/\">Shute, Mihaly &amp; Weinberger<\/a> &#x2014; a public interest law firm that specializes in land use &#x2014; intend to host a virtual DEIR comment writing <a href=\"https:\/\/us02web.zoom.us\/webinar\/register\/WN_D-a4jHl-TbGr4Ut2Yjh1Yg\">workshop<\/a> to guide individuals through the public comment writing process. According to the previous <a href=\"https:\/\/us02web.zoom.us\/webinar\/register\/WN_D-a4jHl-TbGr4Ut2Yjh1Yg\">registration page<\/a>, delays in the county&#x2019;s release of the DEIR led to the indefinite postponement of the webinar. Registrants will be notified once the DEIR release date is finalized and the webinar is rescheduled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students for Environmental and Racial Justice (SERJ) will also be hosting public comment writing workshops to encourage students to participate in the process, SERJ organizer Nate Ramos &#x2019;21 M.S. &#x2019;22 told The Daily. In the past, SERJ has supported the Amah Mutsun by fundraising, holding teach-ins and giving presentations to Stanford student organizations on the Protect Juristac movement. To learn more about these initiatives, Ramos encouraged individuals to reach out to SERJ over <a>email<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Educating others on the history of Juristac and the Amah Mutsun is especially important because &#x201C;this history is not told, and it&#x2019;s not told on purpose,&#x201D; Ramos said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lopez agreed with the importance of education when it comes to standing in solidarity with Indigenous people. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s important to tell the truth about the brutal history that indigenous people have suffered due to colonization,&#x201D; Lopez said. In just over a century since Columbus&#x2019;s arrival in the Americas, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/climate-changed-after-europeans-killed-indigenous-americans-2019-2\">90%<\/a> of Indigenous peoples had died. As of today, Indigenous peoples have been dispossessed of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.science.org\/content\/article\/native-tribes-have-lost-99-their-land-united-states\">98.9%<\/a> of their land in the U.S. &#x201C;What we&#x2019;ve been told is a lie, erasure, and coverup of that sinful history,&#x201D; Lopez said. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;At Stanford University there are many, many cultural sites on this campus that were destroyed by its building,&#x201D; Lopez said, alluding to Stanford&#8217;s location on the ancestral lands of the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe. He hopes that through education, people will recognize how much they benefit from this brutal history and stand in solidarity with Indigenous peoples, even beyond the Protect Juristac movement.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alexii Sigona, a Ph.D. candidate in environmental science at the University of California, Berkeley and a member of the Amah Mutsun, recommended that individuals learn about issues facing Indigenous communities and help educate others.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I just encourage folks to really sit with, think and contemplate how they occupy native spaces, what it means to be on stolen land, and what it means to be accountable for the protection of all of our cultures &#x2014; for supporting the cultural survival of all cultures,&#x201D; Sigona said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hannah Moreno, a member of the Amah Mutsun, encouraged individuals to visit <a href=\"http:\/\/native-land.ca\/\">Native Land<\/a> to learn whose land they occupy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;All of this land has been Indigenous,&#x201D; she said, adding that taking some time to engage with this website can help individuals be &#x201C;a little bit more mindful of who land was stolen from &#x2014; the original caretakers of the land.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, organizers emphasized the importance of continued, consistent involvement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;It&#8217;s not &#x2018;I signed the petition. I did my job,&#x2019;&#x201D; Lopez said. &#x201C;We&#8217;re asking that people make a lifetime commitment to supporting tribes and to getting involved everywhere they can.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Protect Juristac organizers explain ways individuals can get involved in opposing the Sargent Quarry project, which would open a

Juristac: The movement to protect a local tribe&#8217;s most sacred site"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Speaking on the floor of the United Nations in April 2018, Chairman of the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band Valentin Lopez <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=P8mxSRuNktc\">described<\/a> how his people&#x2019;s most sacred site may soon be reduced to simply an open pit in the ground. The pain that laced his voice was palpable.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lopez was speaking in opposition to the proposed Sargent Quarry project, which would open a 317-acre pit for sand and gravel mining on what is known to some as Sargent Ranch and to the Amah Mutsun as Juristac. Located an hour South of Stanford in Gilroy, Juristac is comprised of four sacred hills and translates to &#x201C;place of the Big Head.&#x201D; The Amah Mutsun&#x2019;s Big Head ceremonies are their most important, Chairman Lopez mentioned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Four years later, the Amah Mutsun&#x2019;s fight to protect their sacred site continues.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Amah Mutsun are a landless tribe without federal recognition. Alexii Sigona, a Ph.D. Candidate in Environmental Science at the University of California, Berkeley, and a member of the Amah Mutsun, said the lack of federal recognition limits the opportunities for his people to connect to their land and culture. Sigona said that the Amah Mutsun have experienced extreme dispossession and the suppression of their cultural practices. Many of their traditional knowledge and practices have become dormant as a result, he added.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another member of the Amah Mutsun, Carolyn Rodriguez said that this cultural erasure makes protecting Juristac all the more important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;In order for us to keep learning and revitalizing our culture, especially for the youth and future generations, we need Juristac, so they can connect to it and have ceremonies there,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;How can we do that if it&#x2019;s just an open mine?&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Big Head ceremonies serve many purposes, including healing, renewal and maintaining balance with the four seasons. Lopez explained how tribes would come from all over the area, some as far away as Yosemite, to participate in these ceremonies. This became impossible when the Debt Acquisition Company of America (DACA) submitted its <a href=\"https:\/\/plandev.sccgov.org\/policies-programs\/smara\/sargent\">Sargent Quarry project proposal<\/a> to the Santa Clara County Department of Planning and Development in 2015.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Protect Juristac <a href=\"http:\/\/www.protectjuristac.org\/\">website<\/a> explains that &#x201C;once disturbed by mining, there will be no way to rehabilitate the cultural and spiritual aspects of [Juristac].&#x201D; It also details the extensive environmental impacts of the project, which would eliminate 248 acres of grassland estivation habitat for federally-listed threatened species and destroy approximately 33 acres of California live oak woodland.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DACA did not respond to The Daily&#x2019;s request for comment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the Amah Mutsun contacted the County to let them know of their opposition, they learned that county law allows for this destruction of Juristac.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Santa Clara County has a history of perpetuating the dispossession of indigenous peoples, Chairman Lopez told The Daily. Just north of Juristac is a place known to the Amah Mutsun as Las &#xC1;nimas, meaning the palace of the spirits. On that property reside four significant cultural sites in close proximity &#x2014; within 150 to 200 yards of each other, Lopez estimated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;There was a proposal to put a road right through the middle, and we tried to get both the county to recognize those four cultural sites as a cultural district, so they will all be protected and preserved as a single site,&#x201D; Chairman Lopez said. Instead, the county <a href=\"https:\/\/us.geoview.info\/whitehurst_road,162284183w\">recognized<\/a> the sites as four individual sites. &#x201C;They approved the row going right through the middle of it&#x2014;right through the middle of a cultural district,&#x201D; the Chairman said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lopez also brought up questions surrounding Santa Clara County&#x2019;s compliance with state law regarding the preservation of indigenous sacred and cultural sites. In 2004, California State Senate passed <a href=\"https:\/\/leginfo.legislature.ca.gov\/faces\/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=200320040SB18\">SB 18<\/a>, which directs cities and counties to &#x201C;conduct consultations with California Native American tribes for the purpose of preserving specified places, features, and objects that are located within the city or county&#x2019;s jurisdiction&#x201D; prior to adopting or amending their general plan. Lopez pointed out that Santa Clara County has never revised its general plan&#x2014;on the county&#x2019;s Department of Planning and Development <a href=\"https:\/\/plandev.sccgov.org\/ordinances-codes\/general-plan\">website<\/a>, the most updated general plan is the one adopted in December 1994 for the years 1995 to 2010.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Had the county updated its general plan and consulted with tribes, Lopez said, the Amah Mutsun would have mentioned Sargent Ranch. Upon learning that Juristac is a cultural site, the county also could have amended its general plan, Lopez added.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;They did not do it then, and they have not done it yet,&#x201D; he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked about the county&#x2019;s adherence to SB 18, Leza Mikhail, Santa Clara County Planning Services Manager, said &#x201C;SB 18 requires tribal consultation for general plan amendments but does not mandate amendments to the general plan to address tribal cultural resources. To the extent the County has amended the general plan since 2004, the SB 18 consultation requirements have been followed.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mikhail did not respond to The Daily&#x2019;s questions as to why the general plan has not been amended, despite the fact that the most recent plan was only intended to last until 2010.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;The county could have done better, but they did not,&#x201D; Lopez said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the county&#x2019;s general plan has not been revised, Lopez explained, the current general plan allows for the proposed sand and gravel mining at Juristac.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;The only thing that will stop the development of this mine at Juristac is overwhelming public support,&#x201D; Chairman Lopez stated. Since the Sargent Quarry project proposal came in, the Amah Mutsun has been working tirelessly to get others involved. &#x201C;[We&#x2019;re trying to] get the public to recognize the importance of Juristac to get the county planners to vote to disapprove the mining permit, and if that gets appealed, have the county Board of Supervisors oppose the permit,&#x201D; the Chairman said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chairman Lopez hopes that his people will get to return to Juristac and resume their Big Head ceremonies one day. Until then, the Protect Juristac movement will persist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article is the first in a two-part series about Protect Juristac, a years-long campaign led by the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band to stop sand and gravel mining on their sacred grounds.

Ethnic Studies programs marred by coursework irregularity, students say"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>When Evan Kanji &#x2019;23 shares with his classmates that he is majoring in Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity (CSRE), he is often faced with a variation of the same question: &#x2018;Is that a flavor of Computer Science?&#x2019;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Because the program is so under-resourced, there are not as many people who might major in it or even know about it,&#x201D; Kanji said.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although brilliant ethnic studies scholars have taught at Stanford, Kanji said, they are often restricted due to the limitations created by the program&#8217;s structure within the University.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Majors related to ethnic studies at Stanford are housed as programs, not departments. This means that CSRE programs do not have the ability to hire their own faculty. Rather, they must rely on affiliated faculty housed in other departments, which can cause an inconsistent faculty directory and limited class options within these programs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even amid these problems, Kanji said that his CSRE cohort has been very inspiring for him since everyone seems to have a strong passion that leads them to choose that major.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&#x201C;I wish that the administration would throw their full support behind that passion,&#x201D; Kanji said. &#x201C;That passion is going to be there and persist, regardless.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Class Discrepancies<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Irregularity among faculty often leads to inconsistency and insufficiency in classes offered each quarter, students contend. The Chicana\/o-Latina\/o Studies (CHILATST) program originally had <a href=\"https:\/\/carta-beta.stanford.edu\/results\/CHILATST\">five classes listed on Explore Courses<\/a> for the spring quarter this year. Yet, right before registration opened, <a href=\"https:\/\/explorecourses.stanford.edu\/search?q=CHILATST&amp;view=catalog&amp;page=0&amp;academicYear=&amp;filter-term-Spring=on&amp;collapse=&amp;filter-catalognumber-CHILATST=on&amp;filter-coursestatus-Active=on&amp;filter-departmentcode-CHILATST=on&amp;filter-catalognumber-CHILATST=on\">four of those classes did not appear on<\/a> Axess, leaving students &#x2014; who assumed the classes were canceled &#x2014; unable to enroll and scrambling to find new courses.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, according to Stanford spokesperson Joy Leighton and CHILATST program director Jonathan Rosa, no classes in CHILATST were actually canceled this quarter. Professor Stephen Sano, the Asian American Studies (AAS) program director, attributes this discrepancy to &#x201C;technical weirdness,&#x201D; and miscommunication between the Registrar&#x2019;s Office and the Explore Courses website.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sano offered the course &#x2018;ASNAMST 115: Asian American Film and Popular Culture,&#x2019; which Professor Willian Gow used to teach, as an example. Gow taught ASNAMST 115 last year but has since stopped teaching at Stanford, with no intention of teaching the course this year. However, this course still rolls over to the next year on Explore Courses. These courses then don&#x2019;t show up on Axess for students to enroll in because no one was planning on teaching it.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sano pointed out that this happens very often, and it creates an illusion that more classes are being offered within ethnic studies than there actually are. Although this can take place across all departments, it&#x2019;s most common within ethnic studies programs because the course load varies so heavily from year to year.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, the problem can leave ethnic studies students, who rely on these classes for their degrees, in limbo. The lack of ethnic studies courses offered was part of the reason that Kanji decided to take up a double major in Environmental Systems Engineering.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;A lot of CSRE courses are really cross-listed and they&#8217;re primarily out of another department,&#x201D; Kanji said. &#x201C;That means that course listings can be pretty unreliable, like from one year to the next.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inconsistency within the discipline&#x2019;s offerings can also be compounded by the short-term nature of lecturer jobs, which the program can hire for only a one-quarter period. Rosa said that this year, the program hired lecturer Omi Salas-SantaCruz, who taught Trans Latinx Studies in the winter, and lecturer Lucia Leon, who taught Intersectional (In)equalities: Latina\/o(x) Families in the U.S in the spring. Neither of these classes are likely to be taught again because both short-term lecturers are no longer at Stanford.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although students have expressed heightened interest in these courses, Rosa said that it is impossible to maintain that caliber of curriculum that students deserve. Caelin Dae Marum &#x2019;21 M.S. &#x2019;22, who majored in Native American Studies during her undergrad, experienced this during her sophomore year when visiting lecturer Shawon Kinew taught a class on the history of California Natives.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I only ever heard amazing things about her teaching and her classes, but I never got to take it because it was sophomore year and I was packed with requirements,&#x201D; Marum said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>An impossible four-year plan<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Limited course offerings adds another level of stress for students trying to major in ethnic studies. Students at Stanford typically work to fulfill their major requirements during their sophomore year. To graduate with a Stanford degree, students must complete at least 180 units, though each major has specific unit requirements. If class offerings within a major constantly change, students do not know what is being offered throughout the course of their time at Stanford, or if the classes that are offered will even count toward their major. Because of this, fluctuating course offerings is incredibly stressful for CSRE majors.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though Marum enjoyed the courses available within the program, by her senior year it became difficult to find new classes and subject matters to learn about.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>&#x201C;It&#8217;s really difficult for faculty to be able to give somebody an enriched four years of Native studies class, just because they&#8217;re so focused on everything else that they&#8217;re doing,&#x201D; Marum said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity (CCSRE) Director Paula Moya acknowledged the growing interest in CSRE courses, which the program hopes to accommodate in the near future: &#x201C;In order to provide stable curricula in these areas, we are in the process of hiring Associate Directors for the different Programs in CCSRE,&#x201D; Moya said. &#x201C;We hope that these searches will soon allow Stanford and CCSRE to provide, on a regular basis, the kind of introductory and advanced courses that students want. In the meantime, we hope to have an opportunity to meet with students interested in strengthening our core curriculum to hear more about their concerns.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rosa added that four-year plans are very difficult to sustain. Students are often left having to scramble a major together through one-off classes, cross-listed courses and directed readings.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;[Students] really need a much more robust, better structured, substantive, intellectual opportunity. This is Stanford. We have the resources to do it. So we have to work together to advocate for it, and to build it,&#x201D; Rosa said.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&#x2018;It limits brilliance&#x2019;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the lack of resources allocated toward CSRE, Kanji praised the program for being able to create a space on campus where it&#x2019;s acceptable to talk about racial issues and systemic inequality explicitly, which he feels is lacking in other departments. Although his experience has been positive and he is appreciative of the current faculty who work incredibly hard to maintain the programs, Kanji said he is aware of Stanford&#x2019;s negligence toward CSRE.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;We&#8217;re sort of left to stick together a program out of who&#8217;s around&#x2026; It limits brilliance,&#x201D; Kanji said. &#x201C;There are really brilliant racial scholars here whose voices don&#8217;t get the platform they deserve and don&#8217;t get to reach as many students as they should because of the way the department is limited.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phong Nguyen &#x2019;25, a prospective AAS major, echoed these sentiments, adding that &#x201C;Stanford boasts how it really gives back to ethnic studies and all of that, but I think all it really does is introduces it and does not properly invest into those systems of learning.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rosa stressed the importance of remembering all of the student activism that led to the creation of CSRE, including a <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2014\/05\/23\/fighting-for-the-future-a-history-of-the-1994-hunger-strike\/\">hunger strike<\/a> by Chicanx students in the 90s. Student activism, including a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/after-50-years-it-is-time-for-aaas-at-stanford-to-become-a-department?utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=custom_url&amp;recruited_by_id=cd9f2f10-cf59-11e7-846e-2955359b1e93\">petition<\/a> created by the Black Student Union (BSU) and the Black Graduate Student Association (BGSA) in the summer of 2020, has also led to the departmentalization of <a href=\"https:\/\/aaas.stanford.edu\/\">African and African American studies<\/a> (AAAS). This departmentalization comes after over 50 years of student activism by the BSU and BGSU.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rosas, who was a part of the <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/2020\/10\/09\/senate-hears-presentation-proposed-new-school-sustainability\/\">faculty task force<\/a> assembled by the University to asses race programming across campus, said that an important aspect of solidarity is recognizing the work done within AAAS and the student activism that led to its departmentalization. Rosa is currently a part of the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/03\/08\/plan-for-aaas-departmentalization-to-be-sent-to-stanford-admin-in-may\/\">Committee for the Departmentalization of AAAS<\/a>, which is working with faculty and students across the University as well as racial scholars at peer universities to develop the AAAS curriculum.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;One of my roles on that committee has been to ensure that Black Latin American, Caribbean and Latinx studies is a crucial component of the department of Black Studies. But we&#8217;re also trying to incorporate community engagement, engaging with the arts and technology&#x2026; that are central to our work here at Stanford,&#x201D; Rosa said.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To solve the fractured structure of ethnic studies programs, Rosa said that the University should follow the lead of peer institutions like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.westernhistory.org\/news\/11110477#:~:text=The%20Latinxs%20and%20Democracy%20Cluster,and%20social%20inclusion%20and%20wellbeing.\">UC Berkeley<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/chancellor.ucla.edu\/messages\/making-strides-towards-becoming-a-hispanic-serving-institution\/\">UCLA<\/a>, who have both committed to cluster hires of Latinx faculty and scholars within the next few years. Such progress will ultimately come down to students&#x2019; ability to come together and advocate for a change, he said.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;It&#8217;s important to honor the struggles that went into building this very fragile structure that is still limited, and to recognize that people have worked to create this while also articulating its limitations,&#x201D; Rosa said. &#x201C;[In the 90s] students worked in solidarity. I think we need similar such solidarity now to continue to build.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lack of ethnic studies departmentalization

on the Farm: evaluating Stanford&#8217;s incoming men&#8217;s basketball players"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>While we&#x2019;re in the thick of the college basketball off-season, Stanford men&#x2019;s basketball has finalized its roster for next season. Here&#8217;s an evaluation of Stanford&#x2019;s incoming recruits and transfers, along with a discussion of how they will fit into the team&#x2019;s play style. So, without further ado, let&#8217;s get started.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michael Jones<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael Jones is a graduate transfer from Davidson College. Jones&#x2019; best attribute is his ability to shoot from distance. In fact, this past season, Jones displayed efficiency rarely seen at the collegiate level, shooting 46% from the field, 42% from behind the arc and 84% from the line while averaging 11 points per game. Jones registered these numbers on a Davidson team that competed as a ten seed in the NCAA Tournament, indicating that his stats contributed to the team&#8217;s success.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jones&#8217; shooting will impact Stanford&#x2019;s offense in a myriad of ways. In Stanford&#x2019;s ball-screen motion offense, Jones could have the chance to score off dribble hand-offs in the mid-range and 3-point areas and off back screens on the weak side. Also, he should get catch-and-shoot opportunities from filling empty space on the wing and moving off pindown screens.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Stanford tends to lift its forwards to the free throw line, which creates plenty of room around the rim. This will allow Jones to execute back-door cuts if defenses play him tightly to guard his perimeter shooting. Moreover, Jones will have plenty of opportunities in transition and on the fast break to spot-up from distance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of games, Jones will be a valuable asset, as Stanford needs a reliable free throw shooter to close out close contests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ryan Agarwal<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ryan Agarwal is a 6-foot-7 wing from Coppell, Texas. A 3-star recruit according to <a href=\"https:\/\/247sports.com\/player\/ryan-agarwal-46102422\/\">247 Sports<\/a>, Agarwal committed to Stanford back in March of 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to Jones, the best aspect of Agarwal&#x2019;s game coming out of high school is his shooting. But unlike Jones, Agarwal lacks collegiate experience. In addition, Agarwal seems a bit more adept at creating his own shot off the dribble than Jones. This means Agarwal may be more proficient on dribble handoffs or coming off of ball screens in Stanford&#x2019;s motion offense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, Agarwal possesses a wiry frame, which could prevent him from being able to finish well around the rim, perform strong back-cuts and create for himself at the college level. Right now, it seems Agarwal will be best at hitting shots off spot-ups and pin-downs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jaylen Thompson<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jaylen Thompson is a 6-foot-8 wing from Alameda, California. A 4-star according to <a href=\"https:\/\/247sports.com\/player\/jaylen-thompson-46094788\/\">247 Sports<\/a>, Thompson committed to the Cardinal in September of 2021.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thompson likely has the greatest ceiling out of all the incoming players due to his athletic ability and long wingspan, which is over seven feet. Like Jones and Agarwal, Thompson possesses an elite touch from three. In addition, Thompson&#x2019;s athleticism and wingspan will make him an important piece of the defense for Stanford going forward, as the roster lacks long, athletic and versatile defenders. Thompson also has the best on-ball skills out of all the newcomers, as he is comfortable creating for himself through a variety of one-dribble pull ups and step backs. Thompson is proficient at battling on the boards and securing rebounds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But similar to Agarwal, Thompson may need to add a bit of weight and strength to reach his full potential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, it seems head coach Jerod Haase has put an emphasis on outside shooting, as all three newcomers are very adept at shooting from distance. While it seems Jones will be able to contribute from day one because of his high-level contribution on an NCAA tournament team, it remains to be seen how quickly the freshman will adjust to the bump in competition.&#xA0;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the midst of the off-season, the Stanford men&#8217;s basketball team has finalized its roster for next year.

Turn to your family members and friends if they&#8217;re in the stands or watching from around the world.&#x201D; Graduates then stood up, turned around and waved towards the bleachers with audible calls of gratitude.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/FsjLYPcKfr4de4zUJP8gZNd2MrhYmtygfYR9BRAdBrbu2k-GdpgX-CC5vyTq5Acq1xnb1-N3T43-UEJNEz2VB8sKh0SUNgGLUW-ZxuzDThwVVXMRhq1iu-qGHIvOVPucI5BXAK1q7WVn0PyfgA\" alt=\"\" \/><figcaption><em>Stanford faculty, university officers, and trustees procession.

I know you&#8217;re up to the challenge. I&#8217;ve seen it.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He used the Stanford community&#x2019;s response to the war in Ukraine as an example of such contributions, applauding University-wide fundraising efforts to support Ukraine, as well as academic contributions from Stanford&#8217;s Freeman Spogli Institute.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/a-TznwYPkln_uzKiQFokq33h-6mJR0pJOut6si0SJ4DMm4iXdNpV_7yBMfx7tD0Hk-esA9SP-rMdc9cQnM6dvhenlxrgFVSU_jlGXSBmluce5Hgb3bm3DDc0VGMFMKzQJnjrDIOwW8b6yf_AVQ\" alt=\"\" \/><figcaption><em>Graduates exit Stanford Stadium after the 131st Commencement Ceremony.

During the President&#x2019;s welcome address, attendees were distracted by an airplane banner advertisement that read, &#x201C;Congratulations to the Stanford graduates; Boycotting working at Facebook and Google.&#8221; The banner-carrying aircraft circled the stadium for much of the ceremony.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I&#8217;ve been speaking this morning about how life is lived in chapters, though in Reed&#8217;s case perhaps I should say life is lived in episodes,&#x201D; joked Tessier-Lavigne as he handed the stage to Hastings, who started his pre-recorded video speech by removing his mask.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his speech, Hastings shared his love of inventions but emphasized that he has not always had luck with them. He recalled an idea he had that would save users the time of moving their hands back and forth from the keyboard to the mouse on old desktop computers. &#x201C;I had a great idea: the foot mouse,&#8221; Hastings said, explaining that he nearly dropped out of Stanford to work on the invention. &#x201C;I stayed and graduated like all of you. I didn&#8217;t give up on new ideas, and 10 years after discarding the foot mouse, we created Netflix.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hastings concluded his speech by drawing an analogy between one&#8217;s life trajectory and the story of the tortoise and hare, &#x201C;Some of you will be hares, getting your first jobs at Google and Goldman, making your first billion by 30. I hope you stay grounded with all that early success.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turning to people who might not be as fast, he offered advice and words of encouragement, emphasizing that he, too, was a tortoise.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Maybe your path won&#8217;t be clear or you&#8217;ll keep starting over in different areas,&#8221; Hastings said. &#x201C;Applaud your hare friends and their successes, but don&#8217;t let it bother you. When you are older, you will love each other more if you accept each other&#8217;s unique paths.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/uHYk5tKiHImXz89w_Ex5pCp7ETdC8oIWZTCJueGlhILMfQk8XnvbNLW-P_07X5kiFaR4fWupKJCixo8-wNwv33BH698ygbHEzkfd0zSUHUxhnW9iRpNslijwwroOfe8Mn8QpfmwuZXVnw7GRqA\" alt=\"\" \/><figcaption><em>United States and California flags wave before the Commencement Ceremony.

face challenges under new housing selection system, question effectiveness"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>When Butch Nasser &#x2019;25 logged onto the housing portal for his gate time last Thursday, he was hoping to find a male double in Kimball Hall. What he saw on his screen was a far different message: &#x201C;There are no available rooms that match your criteria.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nasser spent the next half hour refreshing the page until a few more rooms popped up. But they were all in Mirrielees, which Nasser knew he could not live in.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mirrielees, which offers apartment-style living, requires residents to pay around $1,400 for three quarters  of housing in addition to the regular housing fee. As a first-generation, low-income (FLI) student, Nasser cannot afford to pay this extra fee, which is not covered by any of Stanford&#x2019;s financial aid packages. Now, his only option is to hope he can convince someone to switch residences with him, or that he will be reassigned to a new dorm in July.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year marked the second year that students have signed up for housing under the recently implemented neighborhood system, a ResX initiative launched this year that divides Stanford&#x2019;s row houses, themed housing, apartments and dorms among seven different neighborhoods, each bearing a different letter of the Stanford name. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the neighborhood system, which seeks to create meaningful and strong residential communities for students, came a new self-select model for students to secure housing for the upcoming school year. It was created to remedy some of the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2019\/04\/16\/housing-draw-to-be-phased-out-students-to-be-assigned-to-neighborhoods-instead-resx-report-announces\/\">complexities and unfairness<\/a> of the old draw system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, as students signed up for housing last week, many of the same concerns re-emerged. While Stanford administrators acknowledge these concerns and disappointment are not new, they are planning to incorporate student feedback while continuing to adjust the new assignment process. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Nasser was first assigned to Mirrielees, he emailed the financial aid office to see if he could get financial support for the residence&#x2019;s additional fees. They told him that, while his scholarship did not cover Mirrielees&#x2019;s living expenses, he could switch from an undergraduate meal plan of 21 meals a week to an apartment meal plan of five meals a week and cook his own meals to save money. The suggestion did not account for the additional expenses of buying his own groceries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I think for FLI students, it&#x2019;s kind of predatory to force someone into a room that&#x2019;s more expensive than what they can afford [and] say that one of your best options is to eat less, essentially,&#x201D; said Nasser.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeking another solution to his predicament, Nasser emailed R&amp;DE&#x2019;s student housing division, asking them if there was any way for him to switch housing with other students.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The student housing division said they would set up a self-swap process where students could voluntarily switch rooms with each other in a group chat, the caveat being they could only switch rooms if they had identical room types &#x2014; in Nasser&#x2019;s case, a one-room and gender-neutral double, which Nasser never intended to live in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Nasser&#x2019;s chief concern about living in Mirrielees is a financial one, he is also worried about the mental strain of living in apartment style housing as a sophomore. Compared to a traditional dorm, Nasser worries about the isolation he&#x2019;ll experience in Mirrielees without any other members of his draw group.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s not how I imagined spending my sophomore year at Stanford. Freshman year was a blast in a dorm, and I really wanted to live at least one, maybe even two, three [years] with it [in a dorm] and seems like that&#x2019;s not going to happen,&#x201D; Nasser said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As opposed to the previous system, in which R&amp;DE placed draw groups together for housing, the new format offers groups one draw selection time, but no guarantee that they will live together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fellow Neighborhood F resident Hasan Ahmad &#x2019;25 similarly wanted to live in Kimball, but he and his roommate were the only ones from their draw group placed in Mirrielees next year. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s ironic how a system that was supposed to increase the amount of community is actually serving as an obstacle for many rising sophomores who want that community,&#x201D; Ahmad said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Assistant Vice Provost for Residential Education Cheryl Brown, Residential Education will place a greater emphasis next year on building community in apartment style housing. Administrators have already started seeking feedback concerning the residential experience in these apartments, and Brown affirmed that ResEd will be more intentional about involving sophomore residents in community life and connecting them to neighborhood programming.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m hopeful that they don&#x2019;t feel too disconnected,&#x201D; Brown said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Neighborhood F sophomores lamented their placement in apartment-style housing, upperclassmen in different neighborhoods were disappointed by their inability to secure these same residences. Some are now willing to pay other students to switch rooms with them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Quennie Nguyen &#x2019;24, Mirrielees, along with EVGR, offer the exact living situation she is after. &#x201C;The environment at EVGR is known to be isolated, but conducive for studying and that&#x2019;s exactly what I&#x2019;m looking for,&#x201D; explained Nguyen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a Neighborhood O resident, however, by the time her gate time rolled around on Wednesday, there were no longer any slots available in EVGR. Her only available options were a final spot in Storey, a self-op on the row, and rooms in Florence Moore. Nguyen decided to claim the last spot in Storey. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s so frustrating because it&#x2019;s not as if the spaces aren&#x2019;t there,&#x201D; Nguyen said, explaining that her neighborhood and the gender cap limited her access to rooms in EVGR.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nguyen, who will be working and attending school full time next year, while applying to medical school and taking the MCAT and GRE, feels as though having a living space conducive to her academic life is necessary.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After hitting roadblocks with R&amp;DE, she has resorted to offering to pay students to switch dorms with her. She&#x2019;s received one offer, a complicated one requiring two people to switch their housing and for her to pay the difference of switching from Mirrielees to Storey. However, it is not confirmed, and she still hopes to be reassigned in July.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neighborhood N resident Devin Heart &#x2019;23 had been saving his best housing option for his senior year. This would have been rewarded in Stanford&#x2019;s old draw system, in which students saved their first-tier housing for their last year, but is no longer applicable to the self-select model.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While seniors are assigned the earliest gate times, giving them priority in selecting their preferred housing, Heart was still unable to secure the single in EVGR or Mirrielees that he wanted. He now finds himself in the exact same living situation that he had this year: a triple in Mirrielees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heart feels that having a private space as a senior should not be considered a luxury. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not saying everyone should always get what they want, but it should be an equitable system where the upperclassmen aren&#x2019;t getting screwed over,&#x201D; said Heart.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Nguyen, Heart says he is willing to pay other students to switch rooms with him and risk breaking his housing contract so that he can get a single. He said that these types of informal housing agreements have happened in past years, but under the new housing model, an increasing number of students are participating in these informal exchanges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Students will literally go and pay upwards of a few thousand dollars to get their desired housing because the quality of life of living in a shared room, in cramped corners, as an upperclassman is just so bad,&#x201D; Heart explained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of now, Heart has received many offers for room exchanges. He will wait until after reassignment to make a definitive switch to his living situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Brown recognizes that the housing assignment process can be difficult, especially for seniors who could not secure their preferred housing, she emphasized that the disappointment students may feel with their housing is by no means something new. &#x201C;I think people every year have felt this way,&#x201D; Brown said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, the University intends to incorporate feedback from upperclassmen into future administration plans, according to Vice Provost for Student Affairs Susie Brubaker-Cole<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the students fear that there are not many opportunities to address the complaints while working within the neighborhood system. Students in certain neighborhoods, like Neighborhood F, face a particularly challenging housing process because of how few options were available to students &#x2014; the only non-pre-assignment or Greek housing options students could live in were Kimball Hall, EVGR, Mirrielees and the Grove. The Grove is only open to upper-classmen. Rising sophomores, who overwhelmingly sought housing in Kimball, were assigned to EVGR and Mirrielees, which were the first choice of many students in other neighborhoods. Housing in EVGR and Mirrieless is split among all the neighborhoods. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To Ahmad, the neighborhood system &#x201C;goes against much of the goals of college, which is to have as diverse of an experience, as exciting and as ever-changing an experience as possible, given how, for the rest of your life, you&#x2019;re going to be in an apartment, or you&#x2019;re going to be living with the same person or people.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students also believe that the neighborhood system has fallen short of one of its primary goals &#x2014; fostering community between students. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s not how you build community &#x2014; force people to live in places,&#x201D; Heart said, calling the neighborhood system a &#x201C;talking point.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Brown and Brubaker-Cole, the neighborhood system was built to address the struggles students had in past years to maintain community and friendships as they moved to different places on campus each year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;The model that we&#x2019;re working with now, with the neighborhoods, is intended to mitigate some of that shuffling, reshuffling every year of the community,&#x201D; Brubaker-Cole said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brown and Brubaker-Cole both emphasized that the model is still in its very first year of implementation, so the administration is constantly making adjustments and learning from students about potential for improvement &#x2014; the model underwent <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/report\/2022\/01\/10\/important-updates-preparation-2022-23-undergraduate-housing-assignments\/\">various changes in January<\/a>, responding to student feedback.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;The neighborhood system is like the framework or foundation of a building that we are counting on students to help us complete,&#x201D; Brubaker-Cole said.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This year marked the second year that students have signed up for housing under the recently implemented neighborhood system, a ResX

we stand"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p><em>Jack Golub graduated Stanford in 2020. He now teaches English in Austin, Texas. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Classes of 2020 and 2021 (and perhaps even 2022),<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I left Stanford and became a teacher. My school is pretty different from Stanford, though. A lot of the students never pay attention. Our principal is a bit, uh, robotic. We don&#x2019;t treat our custodial staff as an integral part of our school community&#x2026; Alright, perhaps not as different as I thought.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In all seriousness, Stanford is different. At Stanford, I struggled. I often felt listless and confused. Spring quarter I&#x2019;d usually get a little depressed. I guess getting drunk at 11 a.m. just didn&#x2019;t do it for me. But I felt loved. I felt loved and supported by my peers, right from the start. My frosh year, half the dorm tried to help me learn CS106A. That they failed is irrelevant. My junior year, as an RA, I was down bad at times. My friends reached out to me. They came to see me. They listened, even when I had nothing to say. At Stanford, I felt confident that the people around me had my back. I knew my administration had the resources to provide me with an unparalleled education, including a daily menu of rich cultural events.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I largely felt that my Stanford journey lived up to our motto, &#x201C;let the winds of freedom blow.&#x201D; I was given a gift that let me grow. Not everyone gets that gift.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I currently teach seventh grade in Austin, Texas. I chose to teach because I thought I could connect deeply with students and uncover, for them to see, a surprisingly vast potential. Uvalde sits only a couple hours away from my school.&nbsp;Since May 24, grief and anger have stolen my thoughts. I have felt lost. I cried in front of my students as I lied to them, telling them that I would protect them no matter what, all while knowing that my body won&#x2019;t beat an AR-15. I have felt small. I needed to remind myself that we, recent and new Stanford graduates, stand on the shoulders of giants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand on the shoulders of the strong and loving Muwekma Ohlone tribe, a people who have survived and continue to survive colonialism and white supremacy. They are capable of such strength that they continue to love this sacred land, where they have lived for thousands of years, at every cost.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand with conviction on the shoulders of bell hooks, whose fierce voice for justice still resonates in her absence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand expressively, and yes, securely, on the shoulders of Issa Rae.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand in all-white Air-Force 1s on the shoulders of Phil Knight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand thousands of miles beyond earth on the shoulders of Mae Jemison and Sally Ride.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand on the physically less imposing yet altogether revolutionary shoulders of Sergey Brin and Larry Page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand bravely, ready to speak truth to power, on the shoulders of Christine Blasey Ford.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand on the shoulders of Stanford luminaries. Shoulders that are daunting in their size and, sometimes, in their shortcomings. To recognize how big we are, we must acknowledge both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand on the shoulders of the first president of Stanford, David Starr Jordan: pioneering psychologist, strategic president and prominent eugenicist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand on Leland Stanford&#x2019;s shoulders. Our founder who was ahead of his time in creating a coed school loosened from some constraints of established gender norms. He built this school with money made from exploiting Chinese railroad workers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have been poured into by our families and this school. Our teachers in the front of the room, our teachers sitting alongside us, our teachers serving us food, our teachers cleaning our bathrooms and those teachers calling us, asking when next are we coming home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2020 and 2021, we stand here, now, at the perfect time. We are not eager to burst forth, filled with passion and optimism, onto a broken world awaiting our leadership. We are not looking ahead to what doors this Stanford degree will open for us in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the future. We are already here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have learned that those doors won&#x2019;t magically open. Sometimes, the task of taking care of ourselves is more than enough for one day. The amazing future of fulfillment and powerful change that we normally would be promised during this weekend has, for many of us, not quite arrived on time. Maybe it got stuck in the Tresidder mail office. The line looks long, and I don&#x2019;t have my ID card anymore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I won&#x2019;t pretend that our good intentions and intelligence are enough. I won&#x2019;t ask for a moment of silence so that we can acknowledge our grief and then move on. The change we desperately need in the world won&#x2019;t happen until we change ourselves. Until we realize, collectively, that we have been given a gift that can never be earned or repaid. We stand so high, on such grand and great shoulders, such flawed shoulders, that we cannot come down. We are here to stay. Whatever we do with the power of our knowledge and our relationships furthers the legacy of this school. For better or for worse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of us have already begun honoring this gift. Since March 2020, we have learned of the courageous and creative capacities we hold within. When Stanford abruptly kicked us off campus we instinctively thought of others. We built a robust mutual aid network in mere days. One of us mobilized neighborhood helpers to deliver groceries to those that couldn&#x2019;t get them, literally feeding the hungry. Another assembled a team across the country to design and sell clothing and use the proceeds to buy crucial baby care items that parents and foster parents could not afford. Others of us served in less visible ways. We took care of, even homeschooled younger siblings. We helped family members and friends leave dangerous relationships and battle sickness. We started therapy to become better at loving one another, at loving ourselves. We survived after losing people dear to us. Finally, and this is true, one of us quit Goldman Sachs after only four weeks on the job.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The time to change our expectations of ourselves is not today. This whole weekend is the time to remember and celebrate and give thanks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To remember late nights in the lounge. The shock, which turned to thrill, then eventually irritation at roll outs. The relief at finishing finals followed by the bumbling camaraderie of Nomad. The randomly sunny, 80-degree winter days spent lounging, spike balling and pretending to do work. Those two weeks in 2017 where everyone simultaneously discovered Polo y Pan. The amazement of our first time at Gaieties. The, for some of us, sloppier enjoyment of all the other Gaieties. And, for a few of us, our naked prancing across the stage of our final Gaieties.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To celebrate that we did something difficult together. The challenges we overcame &#x2014; all those late nights in Green Library working on p-sets (I actually can&#x2019;t relate to that one; thank you, humanities), speakers antagonizing us yearly with their false narratives of Christian nationalism, COVID. The moments of triumph &#x2014; the band getting un-banned, securing pay raises for student staff, that moment during every Common Origins performance where all five hundred members are on stage at once and you&#x2019;re thinking to yourself, &#x201C;How is this possible?&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To give thanks that the frantic hallway goodbyes of March 2020 were not permanent. Thanks for the teachers and other staff who believed in us and challenged us in equal measure. For our frosh communities. For the creative writing classes that make everyone who takes them feel like we have something important to share. For the glorious culmination of fellowship that we call Special D. For the relentless student activists who showed us how bright our inner lights can shine in moments of crisis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today is the time to remind ourselves of the gift we have received.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomorrow is the time to change. To do the uncomfortable, setback-ridden work of loving one another more. To push our professional efforts, no matter what we do and especially if it seems unrelated to our society&#x2019;s challenges, closer towards justice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To stay humble and continue to fulfill this tremendously powerful gift.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomorrow, and every day after it, is the time to use that gift.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that one of my students makes it into Stanford.

| Thanks, Stanford. It\u2019s been extraordinary"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Strive for the extraordinary. This was the topic of my college admissions essays and the mentality that took me on a trans-Atlantic journey to study in the United States. As a 12-year-old schoolgirl I was asked where I dreamed of attending university, and I shyly replied with the name of the nearest big city to my hometown in England. The smiling adult was suitably impressed, but I remember thinking to myself &#x2014; imagine their response if they knew the truth. I want to attend university in California.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s difficult to pinpoint exactly when or where the dream started, but this was the moment when I decided for myself to turn this dream into a plan. I was probably inspired in the early days by &#x201C;High School Musical&#x201D; or some other Disney Channel fantasy filled with cheerleaders, dancing on the tables during lunch break, and teenagers wearing their <em>own clothes <\/em>instead of a school uniform. But on reflection, there was something more about California that called out to me. I pictured a way of life where my disability would cease to be a barrier due to the warmer climate and relative accessibility of the environment compared to the ancient architecture of the U.K. I fantasized about rolling along smooth, wide boulevards in my powered wheelchair and basking in the independence that a college campus would afford me. I was enchanted by the idea of being different for some reason other than my disability, relishing in the prospect of small talk about my accent and growing up in a quaint British town. As I felt increasingly isolated from my school friends because of my physical limitations, I longed for a taste of acceptance and believed America held the answer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I thrive on having a goal and I knew what I had to do to put my plans into action. Learning was something I excelled at and getting good grades was the only option. My anxieties about fitting in among my peers faded because I had my sights set somewhere beyond high school, and I accepted not being able to go out and socialize in the same way as everyone else because I was using that time to get where I wanted more than anything to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I developed the confidence to share my ambitions, I learned that it&#x2019;s okay for people not to believe in you. In part, their laughter at my plans energized me because I knew that I was about to prove them all wrong. At the precise moment my parents were told I would not survive beyond the age of six, my life became all about defying the odds. One by one, I worked through the list of components that would make studying abroad possible: academic achievement, impressive extracurriculars, generous financial aid, access to robust healthcare, complex travel logistics for my powered wheelchair, funding for 24\/7 caregivers to enable me to pursue an education outside of my home country &#x2026; the list goes on. I had never spent more than a weekend away from my parents, so the greatest hurdle of all was trusting each other that I could do this independently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The desire to prove myself was ingrained in me from an early age, in part as a character trait and in part as a manifestation of my internalized ableism. For my life to have value, nothing I ever did could be mediocre. Studying in the U.S. was the ultimate symbol of overcoming my disability, and the fact that I got into Stanford was the icing on the cake.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">***<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With graduation only a few days away, I can confidently say that my time at Stanford has been extraordinary. But as is often the case, it has been so in the most unexpected of ways.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Academically, not only have I majored in a field that I never once considered prior to my sophomore year, but I have grown in my appreciation of knowledge for knowledge&#x2019;s sake rather than focusing on education as primarily a means to an end. I gradually learned that fulfillment would come from enrolling in classes that I actually wanted to take &#x2014; not those I felt I ought to &#x2014; and I ultimately carved out a learning experience that has been truly authentic to my passions. Most unexpectedly of all, I found myself in Oxford courtesy of BOSP and the COVID-19 pandemic, and it was there that I first began to believe in myself as a real scholar, discovering an academic niche that went on to shape the latter half of my Stanford experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the people I have been lucky enough to meet along the way, I would have to agree with the majority of students when they say that the people here are the best thing about Stanford. I arrived as a freshman craving social connection, but quickly realized that forming relationships was an evolving process that required me to step out of my comfort zone and tap into a vulnerability that I had been so averse to all my life. It wasn&#x2019;t just going to happen for me &#x2014; <em>even in America<\/em>. Despite this yearning for social bonds, I spent years convincing myself that I would be fine either way because I had goals that I was intent on achieving, but I now recognize wholeheartedly that when everything else is falling apart, my social ties and points of meaningful connection are what keep me afloat. I have found friendships that teach me new things about myself every day, and I am eternally grateful for their acceptance of me in all my strength and fragility. They have shown me that I bring value as a friend too, helping me drown out the voice that &#x2014; echoed by a society that sees people with disabilities as disabled first and human only second &#x2014; insists otherwise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, I came to Stanford seeking an escape from my disabled self, but in reality I have experienced the exact opposite. In some ways the everyday challenges of college life have brought my disability into sharper focus than ever before, and in certain moments I have found myself just longing for the ability to walk so that I would not have to spend another day facing institutional inaccessibility and &#x2014; you guessed it &#x2014; a lack of wheelchair accessible transport. What these moments have shown me, however, is that I can be more honest with myself about my experience with disability, and I hope that my writing today is a testament to that. Finding connection and belonging in the disability community at Stanford has encouraged me not to run from but to embrace this part of my identity, and I have learned to use advocacy for myself and others as a source of power. Despite my best intentions, Stanford has helped me grow into my disability, but I will leave this campus as a more complete version of myself because of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">***<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Graduation has come around far too quickly, and I have never been good at saying goodbye. I could write a book about the incredible experiences and opportunities that have defined my Stanford experience in so many unique and wonderful ways, but that&#x2019;s not what this column is about. At The Daily, writing about disability has been my &#x2018;thing,&#x2019; so, as a final farewell, I wanted to write candidly about how I have experienced Stanford &#x2014; from beginning to end &#x2014; through the lens of my disability. It certainly wasn&#x2019;t perfect, but looking back I hardly recognize my freshman self for all the best reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The page has turned and the next chapter is dawning &#x2014; onto sunny LA because this Cali girl isn&#x2019;t going anywhere! &#x2014; but as I leave this campus behind for now, I am most grateful to Stanford for showing me the true meaning of <em>extraordinary<\/em>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;Graduation has come around far too quickly, and I have never been good at saying goodbye,&#8221; writes Tilly Griffiths. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1002036,"featured_media":1205507,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[24],"tags":[567,19139,6687,5309,738,5268,78201],"site-layouts":[],"coauthors":[51801],"parsely":{"version":"1.1.0","meta":{"@context":"https:\/\/schema.org","@type":"NewsArticle","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/08\/griffiths-thanks-stanford-its-been-extraordinary\/"},"headline":"Griffiths | Thanks, Stanford.

boy. Probably because my whole life, people have been telling me how wonderful I am.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was my grandparents&#x2019; first grandchild, a precocious little girl with a pair of lungs that would give DJ Khaled a run for his money. In elementary school, I was writing my first several novels (and plays that I acted out for my family in the living room). I was then accepted into a prestigious middle school that you had to test into, I went to the same high school that Timothee Chalamet and Nicki Minaj went to and I got into Stanford Fucking University.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#x2019;m not saying I went into Stanford thinking I was hot shit &#x2026; but I went into Stanford thinking I was hot shit. My first reality check came when I walked into my first class on the first day, and found out that economics isn&#x2019;t just the study of how to do taxes (which might seem like common knowledge to you but was a harsh realization for me). But then somehow freshman year just turned into a series of revelations that I&#x2019;m NoT aS sPeCiAl As My MoM tOlD mE i WaS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>I had to switch Econ 1 to credit\/no credit because I was, how shall I say, <em>failing all of my p-sets and tests.<\/em><\/li><li>I auditioned for the plays &#8220;Lulu,&#8221; &#8220;The Seagull,&#8221; &#8220;The Panza Monologues,&#8221; &#8220;Godot Has Come&#8221; and &#8220;Stupid Fucking Bird,&#8221;<em> <\/em>all of which I was ~rejected from~.<\/li><li>I tried out for the Stanford mock trial team, because I was something of a mock trial goddess in high school, and then I was ~promptly rejected from that too~.<\/li><li>I applied to literally spend my weekends helping plan Stanford&#x2019;s Admit Weekend for incoming freshmen, and my application got ~denied~.<\/li><li>I got my first B winter quarter after <em>locking myself in my room for an entire 12-hour day to write a 15-page final paper in which I literally wrote down and justified arguments I did not agree with because I knew the professor agreed with them.<\/em><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know it might seem like I&#x2019;m making light of all these failures (probably because I when I&#x2019;m upset I deflectttt it with humorrrr), but after a while, the waterworks and phone calls home became a not infrequent occurrence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But although Stanford had taken a lot of things from me &#x2014; my scholastic aptitude, my talent for acting, my ability to present well in my resum&#xE9; and in my academic writing &#x2014; there was one thing Stanford had left untouched: my appearance. Although I felt like an incompetent, untalented dimwit, at least I still felt like a <em>hot<\/em> incompetent, untalented dimwit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I felt this way, I decided that I had nothing to lose in asking out a cute boy from one of my classes. He was unlike all of the boys I had ever dated before &#x2014; smart, literate, decent &#x2014; and although he was a little nerdier-looking than the boys I would normally go for, under those thick-brimmed glasses lay a very conventionally handsome face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one day, I waited for him after class (which happened to be the one day where instead of jetting out of the building and back to his dorm, he stayed behind to talk to the professor just so that in waiting outside for him I would look ~that much creepier~), and asked if I could talk to him for a moment. (One of the really lucky things I got to experience that day was what it would feel like to have a heart attack. In the moments before he emerged from the building, my heart was beating so fast that I feared it would be visible through my clothes, and sweat was pooling up all hither and thither.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The boy said yes, and honestly, I had been so worried about how exactly I should phrase the question, and exactly how long the pause would be before he gave an answer, and what the answer would even be, that I had completely neglected to imagine what it would be like if he said yes. But he did, and then there was a long pause because I hadn&#x2019;t prepared what to say next &#x2026; and then he goes, &#x201C;so &#x2026; should we exchange numbers?&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we exchanged numbers, and eventually we decided on a time and place. But when I received a text message that day asking to postpone, and as that day (and many others) came and went, it became evident that all the time I had devoted to researching the &#x201C;top ten most breathtaking wedding destinations&#x201D; &#x2026; might have been a little premature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From then on, I became hypersensitive to the way he and I did not interact in class, and how he continued to book it out of the building after every lesson. And I began to feel so stupid &#x2014; how could I have been naive enough to build up this love story in my head when it was clearly totally one-sided?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then I realized that perhaps fathoming that a boy I was interested in might not be interested in me &#x2026; wasn&#x2019;t all that crazy. In a world of 8 billion people, it was always going to be a 50\/50 toss-up <s>that he would be the type of person capable of appreciating my devastating beauty or the type of person who is blind<\/s>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past four years, I have wrestled with this concept of self-worth. As Stanford students, I think many of us have grown up accustomed to external validation &#x2014; whether those be grades, or awards, or college admissions. There is so much temptation to view our self-worth through the lens of these accolades. But when I think about the incredible people I&#x2019;ve met at Stanford &#x2014; my best friends &#x2014; none of this factors into what make them impressive to me. Rather, my best friends are kind, they&#x2019;re compassionate, they&#x2019;re funny, dependable, courageous and resilient. It just so happens that they can also speak a million languages and hack into the mainframe and all that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#x2019;m a senior now, and what I&#x2019;ve learned from my time at Stanford is this: we mustn&#x2019;t feel that we are entitled to anything &#x2014; to admission into a club, to a good grade, to a boy. For not only does entitlement lead us to calamity when things don&#x2019;t go our way, but it also encourages us not to work hard for things. While being able to appreciate our strengths leads us to be the self-assured, confident individuals that Stanford admissions officers seek to admit, ignoring our imperfection makes us ill fit to handle the real world, where people aren&#x2019;t always going to see us the way our moms do.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Alexa Gold discusses how her Stanford experience has affected her view of self-worth. &#8220;So I\u2019m not saying I went into Stanford thinking I was hot shit \u2026 but I went into Stanford thinking I was hot shit.

| A letter before your Stanford journey"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Dear Maya,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as I leave Stanford, you will be starting your journey. You have always made sure to blaze your own trails, but I am so excited that we will both be able to call this wonderful, complicated place home. And I know Stanford is excited about the better Martinez-Krams.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The campus looks and feels so different now from when I first stepped onto campus as a student four years ago. There were no neighborhoods, masking guidelines or Barrillaga. My dorm, Freshman Sophomore College, no longer exists. When I was interviewed on a radio show before an Oregon State vs. Stanford baseball series, I could proudly say that The Stanford Daily was still a daily.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember telling you that I joined The Daily and how I won the lottery. Bobby Pragada &#x2019;19 pulled my name out of a hat, randomly placing me in the press box next to King Jemison &#x2019;21 for a Stanford football game day. I asked King what to wear, what to bring and how to write about Stanford&#x2019;s collapse against Utah, but the best advice I received that night came as we left the press conference and walked across the south end zone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Do you want a picture?&#x201D; King asked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;No, I&#x2019;m okay,&#x201D; I told him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Are you sure?&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Well, I guess.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The picture was on my Instagram story a few hours later and still serves as my Twitter cover photo. I stopped to smell the roses, commemorating what became my first of three seasons covering football for The Daily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I appreciated the moment when I announced women&#x2019;s soccer in North Carolina on KZSU 90.1 FM, as mommies texted me material to discuss during a 30-minute delay. I glowed when I interviewed <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2018\/11\/01\/preseason-qa-with-womens-basketball-head-coach-tara-vanderveer\/\">Tara VanDerveer<\/a> for the first time. I texted our family group chat in awe as soon as I finished my interview with <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2019\/04\/26\/final-at-manuel-ledecky-highlight-ninth-episode-of-laughter-permitted-with-julie-foudy\/\">Julie Foudy<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I faltered as well. I watched from the right field press area at Sunken Diamond during the NCAA regional tournament and envisioned returning to the spot in a year. I wish I had paused that moment. The pandemic wiped out the entire tournament, and I was back home living with you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is so easy to rush through college thinking of what is ahead. When taking out your pencil for a Monday morning lecture, it is easy to dream of a Friday afternoon nap. But if you rush through that week, you won&#x2019;t enjoy the Stern burrito bowls on Tuesday, the friend with a nice smile in your Wednesday morning section or the sunset over Hoover Tower on Thursday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It took me a while to grasp this, especially in my writing. You can read back through my early stories and know everything that happened on the field or the court, and nothing that happened outside the lines. Eventually, though, I began to capture the people in the story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2019\/05\/16\/from-the-farm-to-france-three-former-stanford-players-prepare-for-womens-world-cup\/\">Cybele Zhang and I<\/a> wrote about the Stanford players on the U.S. women&#x2019;s national team, and then you and I traveled to France and <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2019\/07\/06\/after-toppling-england-uswnt-to-play-netherlands-in-world-cup-finals\/\">your photograph<\/a> appeared in The Daily. I wrote about the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2021\/02\/27\/the-two-people-bringing-sound-to-maples\/\">people making noise<\/a> in a fan-less Maples Pavilion. I asked players, coaches and media members about Tara VanDerveer&#x2019;s <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/12\/14\/tara-vanderveer-history\/\">1,098 wins<\/a>. I told the story of the football team <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/12\/10\/football-practice-in-park\/\">practicing in the park<\/a>. I found <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/06\/03\/why-i-kneel\/\">my voice<\/a> amid tragedy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am so thankful for the many people who helped me outside The Daily. Nick Sako wrapped me with his parka when I was shivering from the postgame cold as I interviewed David Esquer &#x2019;87 in shorts and a short sleeve shirt. Janie McCauley and I shared desserts in empty arenas, as she shared tips about how to humanize my stories. Jacob Rayburn inspired me with his writing and understanding of an entire campus&#x2019;s worth of athletics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you know, I played club baseball at Stanford. Throughout my whole life, I wanted to end on a good swing whenever I practiced, and I would ask for &#x201C;one more&#x201D; until I got it. This year, I stopped asking for &#x201C;one more.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I looked at the calendar and realized this was my final year playing baseball. Instead of relying on &#x201C;one more&#x201D; swing to fix my mistakes, I treated every day on the field as my last.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, when I caught COVID and isolated while my team played in the regional tournament in Lancaster, I grieved having to follow along on GameChanger, but I knew that I made my last swing my best.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will never know when you will be doing something for the last time. You may go to TAP once a week until you spend your last dining dollars and never order another Pac-12 Burger. You will celebrate turning in your week 10 Math 51 problem set, knowing you will never take another math class. Once, I waved goodbye to sophomore year friends, not knowing the pandemic would delay our next hello by two years.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I learned to appreciate every moment. I am so excited about yours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Love,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Daniel<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Daniel Martinez-Krams reflects on learning to live in the moment. &#8220;It is so easy to rush through college thinking of what is ahead.

mounts 9th inning comeback to advance to Super Regional"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>No. 2 Stanford Baseball (45-15, 21-9 Pac-12) won the Palo Alto regional of the NCAA baseball tournament on Monday evening to advance to the Super Regional round next weekend. It marks the Cardinal&#x2019;s 13th appearance in the Super Regionals in school history.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the opening game of the regional on Friday, Stanford faced off against No. 4 seed Binghamton (22-30, 15-15 America East). The Cardinal put on a great display of all around-hitting in the game, compiling four home runs, five doubles and 11 singles.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After Binghamton scored a single run in the top of the first inning, Stanford promptly responded by going on a 10-run streak in the bottom of the second inning. Sophomore third baseman Drew Bowser started off the scoring spree by doubling to left field, which drove home junior catcher Kody Huff. Soon after, other hitters in the Stanford lineup like sophomore infielder Carter Graham, junior second baseman Brett Barrera and freshman outfielder\/pitcher Braden Montgomery plated runs to give Stanford a 6-1 lead. Then, when Bowser stepped up to bat for his second time in the inning, he hit a big fly with the bases loaded to put Stanford up 10-1.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This deficit was too much for Binghamton, which was a team that scraped into the tournament by winning their mid-major conference tournament. The final score for the game was 20-7 in favor of Stanford.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After advancing past Binghamton, Stanford received their first test of the postseason by going up against the Texas State Bobcats (47-14, 26-4 Sun Belt). Texas State, who was ranked <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncaa.com\/rankings\/baseball\/d1\/d1baseballcom-top-25\">No. 11<\/a> in the final season edition of D1 baseball&#x2019;s rankings, pounced on Stanford early, as junior left fielder Jose Gonzalez hit a solo shot to put the Bobcats up 1-0.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Stanford tied up the game in the second inning after sophomore left fielder Eddie Park hit an RBI single to center field, the Bobcats&#xA0;generated more offense in the middle of the game. Gonzalez hit another solo home run, which put Texas State back in the driver&#x2019;s seat.&#xA0;After Gonzalez&#x2019;s second homer, third baseman Justin Thompson hit a double, and then DH Wesley Faison hit a two-run home run to extend the Bobcats lead to 4-1.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bobcats generated offense when they needed it, but the story of the game was their pitching, as pitchers Levi Wells and Tristan Stivors combined to give up just two runs to the potent Stanford offense. In the end, the Bobcats won the game 5-2.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Facing the prospect of elimination, Stanford had its back against the wall for the remainder of the regional.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the third game on Saturday, Stanford played UC Santa Barbara (44-14, 27-3 Big West). The Gauchos jumped out to an early 4-3 lead at the end of five innings. However, as seen numerous times throughout the season, no lead is safe against this Stanford team.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the sixth inning, junior outfielder Brock Jones hit a two-run RBI double to give Stanford a 5-4 advantage. The Cardinal scored another run in the sixth after a fielding error by Gauchos shortstop Jordan Sprinkle. Although Santa Barbara managed one more run, the Cardinal eventually went on to win the game 8-4, setting up another game with Texas State.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This game might be remembered as the &#x201C;Carter Graham&#x201D; game for a long time, as many believed prior to the game that Graham would not play due to injuries suffered earlier in the series. However, Graham had two home runs in the game, including a three-run shot, to help the Cardinal win 8-4. This win set up a regional-deciding third game between Texas State and Stanford that took place on Monday.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an effort to advance, Texas State decided to start its star closer Tristan Stivors on the mound on Monday night. This decision paid off, as Stivors had a phenomenal performance, giving up just one earned run through seven innings. On the other hand, the Cardinal decided to bullpen their way through the game, bringing in six pitchers to pitch on the mound. Through eight innings, both team&#x2019;s managers seemed to have made the right decisions, as the score was 1-1 going into the ninth inning.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the top of the ninth inning, Montgomery took the mound for the Cardinal as the relief pitcher. After walking his first two batters, Montgomery got Bobcats shortstop Dalton Shuffield to fly out and struck out Justin Thompson. However, after Gonzalez was intentionally walked, Wesley Faison hit a single to plate two runs and put the Bobcats up 3-1. Stanford seemed unlikely to make up this deficit, as its bats had been struggling all night.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as has happened many times this year, just when you might think the team is dead in the water, it makes much-needed clutch plays for a comeback.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With zero outs in the bottom of the ninth, Bowser hit a solo home run to cut the Bobcats&#x2019; lead down to 3-2. Following Bowser, second baseman Tommy Troy hit another solo shot, which tied the game at three apiece. After Texas State made a pitching substitution, Park hit a single to left field, which put the winning run on base. After a groundout and walk, two men were on first and third. Head coach David Esquer put in freshman infielder Trevor Haskins to pinch hit for sophomore pitcher Brandt Pancer. After battling to make it a full count, Haskins pulled a hanging curveball through left field to give Stanford a walk-off win.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">THAT.

Follow along to find out why critics love these films and why you might love them too.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Filmmaker Debra Granik claimed her first 100% score with her 2014 documentary &#x201C;Stray Dog,&#x201D; which offers a contemplative portrait of Vietnam War veteran Ron &#x201C;Stray Dog&#x201D; Hall. Though &#x201C;Stray Dog&#x201D; follows a drastically different protagonist than Granik&#x2019;s 2018 feature film &#x201C;Leave No Trace,&#x201D; it is clear that Granik was able to translate her documentarian interest in everyday life from the former to the latter, resulting in a leisurely picture that enraptures viewers with ease.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Father-daughter duo Will (Ben Foster) &#x2014; an army veteran &#x2014; and Tom (Thomasin McKenzie) are integral to the intrigue of &#x201C;Leave No Trace&#x201D; from the outset. Transient inhabitants of a Pacific Northwest forest park, Will and Tom communicate in tongue clicks and telegraphic sentences, hum nursery rhymes while harvesting crops and take every precaution to stay off the grid. They work, eat and sleep in sync, perfectly content in their peaceful autonomy. That is, until a jogger spots Tom reading in the woods and tips them off to local authorities. A shaky assimilation into conventional life then ensues, and Will and Tom&#x2019;s tight-knit bond begins fraying as Tom surpasses Will in her willingness and ability to adapt to their new life outside the forest.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though its story is specific, &#x201C;Leave No Trace&#x201D; offers a universally resonant critique of institutions that do not adequately care for those they pledge to serve. More particularly, Granik exposes the United States&#x2019; disregard for the mental rehabilitation of its veterans. Bureaucrats and good-natured neighbors offer Will physical accommodations at every turn, but he perpetually lacks the resources to manage his post traumatic stress, which prevents him from truly trusting anybody.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Early in the film, Tom happily follows Will&#x2019;s lead. The first words she says to him are &#x201C;Thank you,&#x201D; and she indulges his unconventional mushroom-cooking contraption without challenge. However, Tom&#x2019;s theatrically comedic pronouncement &#x201C;I&#x2019;m growing&#x201D; &#x2014; perfectly enunciated by McKenzie in a childish monster impersonation &#x2014; and her later fascination at a revolving door finely foreshadow her outgrowth of Will&#x2019;s elected lifestyle.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By juxtaposing Will&#x2019;s and Tom&#x2019;s reactions to polite society, Granik effectively underscores how severely Will&#x2019;s post traumatic stress has eaten away at his core self &#x2014; the one reflected in Tom. She is playful, energetic and sociable. Meanwhile, Will is overwhelmed by stacks of paperwork and the pressure to attend church; midway through the film, Foster brilliantly delivers an acerbic line: &#x201C;If you dress up, show up on Sunday, people will believe certain things about you.&#x201D; When Tom stealthily attempts to lobby for a cell phone, Will, frustrated, tells her with uncharacteristic sternness: &#x201C;Always been able to communicate without all that.&#x201D; The &#x201C;we&#x201D; missing from Will&#x2019;s statement is, to him, always implied; they are a unit. But as their paths diverge further, viewers become tragically aware of how easily Tom is slipping from Will&#x2019;s grasp. That we sense so much relational strain with such scant dialogue is a testament to both Granik&#x2019;s direction and these actors&#x2019; skill in nonverbal performance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While &#x201C;Leave No Trace&#x201D; represents Tom and Will&#x2019;s scission effectively through plot and dialogue, it also does so with referential and recurring visuals. Immediately after their departure from the forest, Will struggles to complete a government questionnaire at a local detainment center, which is filmed in a cold, colorless haze. He mutters that he &#x201C;used to be&#x201D;<em> <\/em>a team player and subsequently admits with sorrowful silence that he suffers from night terrors, yet our attention drifts to the forest wallpaper behind him &#x2014; it appears to envelop him. Later, when he considers leaving another temporary housing accommodation for the forest again, the green in his eyes glint the exact green of the foliage in his view. This kind of attention to detail is what elevates &#x201C;Leave No Trace&#x201D; to more than a flat social problem film. Further, at the film&#x2019;s start, we see a pair of spider webs glistening in the sun &#x2014; representing Will and Tom&#x2019;s mutual mimicry and intimacy. At its close, we only see one flimsy web waving in the wind.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Altogether, Granik uses such diverse techniques to depict the anguish of a father losing his daughter because he cannot heal from his past. Government workers are more concerned with Will&#x2019;s punctuality and paper-filing than his wellbeing, and left to rely on his daughter&#x2019;s good faith, Will&#x2019;s relationship with Tom falters. Will refuses to trust anyone else, caught in the mentality of wartime survival. In one scene, barely able to meet Tom&#x2019;s gaze, Will says he is sorry for risking his life to retrieve supplies. But keenly aware of Granik&#x2019;s use of metonymy to exponentially increase the picture&#x2019;s emotional weight, we feel he is sorry for so much more than that.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>McKenzie and her character glisten gold in this film. Despite Granik&#x2019;s solidly posed social critique, Tom&#x2019;s infatuation with her newfound community shows there is still hope for generational healing. Near the film&#x2019;s close, she caresses bees with her bare hands, subtly declaring that she does not fear being hurt in the ways her father does. Her performance is so raw, so delicately precise, that viewers accommodate simultaneous impressions of Tom&#x2019;s profound pain and her commitment to personal and collective restoration. McKenzie <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nzherald.co.nz\/entertainment\/kiwi-actress-thomasin-mckenzie-wins-nbr-breakthrough-award\/45PZ6ZKA5H53I2GDMBDBLVTUFE\/#:~:text=Kiwi%20actress%20Thomasin%20McKenzie%20has,Trace%2C%20directed%20by%20Debra%20Granik.\">won<\/a> the National Board of Review&#x2019;s Breakthrough Performance Award for her performance in &#x201C;Leave No Trace&#x201D; and subsequently garnered critical acclaim that cast her in recent blockbusters &#x201C;The Power of the Dog&#x201D; and &#x201C;Last Night in SoHo.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The film&#x2019;s bittersweet ending aligns thematically with the veteran experience: these forever-soldiers are teased with happy endings by institutions that have no intention of granting them, and we are left with a mere semblance of hope. &#x201C;Leave No Trace&#x201D; is conscious of the drastic failures of veteran rehabilitation as well as of the well-meaning but futile efforts of bureaucrats &#x2014; intimately revealing the price of these failures in Will and Tom&#x2019;s inevitable division.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article is a review and contains subjective opinions, thoughts and critiques.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With a moving narrative and an unambiguous commentary, Debra Granik&#8217;s latest film shows the inherent and deep-rooted flaws within the American veteran-support system, columnist Malia Mendez writes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1002040,"featured_media":1205248,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[25,40640],"tags":[41745,57,41744,425,1411,1175,12298,962,41746],"site-layouts":[],"coauthors":[51828],"parsely":{"version":"1.1.0","meta":{"@context":"https:\/\/schema.org","@type":"NewsArticle","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/07\/combing-the-100-club-leave-no-trace-balances-social-critique-with-gentle-hope\/"},"headline":"Combing the 100% Club: &#8216;Leave No Trace&#8217;

| Rituals"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>I took an extra long winter break this year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With classes moved online for the first few weeks of the quarter, I decided to stay home in Los Angeles. The extra time led me to looking through stacks and stacks of family photo albums, and one childhood photo of myself, in particular. I&#x2019;m two years old or so, wearing socks and sandals, standing in the yard at home and clutching the day&#x2019;s newspaper. Unfolded, the paper itself was probably as big as I was.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#x2019;t remember this precise photo being taken, but returning to the image nevertheless brought to mind a rush of other memories. Growing up, my Sunday mornings began with the LA Times. For as long as I can remember, my dad and I would head down Franklin Avenue to the neighborhood grocery store and pick up a copy of the weekend edition. (The rare occasion that I was able to pay for the newspaper myself with the spare quarters in my pocket made me feel very adult.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was our ritual. Coming home, newspaper in hand, and sitting around the dining table to read the sports section.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was home.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ritual, however, is probably not a word I would have used to describe this routine until I got to Stanford and realized just how impactful these Sunday mornings were. Last fall, I took ENGLISH 180A: &#8220;Periodicity&#8221; &#x2014; an early modern literature class that, among other topics, explores the inception of the English periodical in the eighteenth century. In one text that struck a particular cord with me, Kevis Goodman describes the ritualization of news consumption that envisions a routine mass ceremony, where readers look to the news each morning and night simultaneously. He writes, &#x201C;The significance of this mass ceremony &#x2014; [Georg Wilhelm Friedrich] Hegel observed that newspapers serve modern man as a substitute for morning prayers &#x2014; is paradoxical. It is performed in silent privacy, in the lair of the skull. Yet each communicant is well aware that the ceremony he performs is being replicated simultaneously by thousands (or millions) of others.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the same sort of communion that I had experienced growing up &#x2014; not just the action of reading itself, but the corresponding community and collective consciousness that it brought. Although, of course, the means of our news consumption continues to change into the 21st century, that very sentiment &#x2014; the mutual forging of reasoning and understanding among the public &#x2014; is what prompted me to join The Daily and what has kept me around for four years.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This ritual of news production and consumption, especially sports reporting, has spanned my entire Stanford experience and perhaps facilitated some of the most meaningful connections I&#x2019;ve made.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before even enrolling as a student, The Stanford Daily brought me community. In a makeshift high school reunion over Admit Weekend, Sarah Wishingrad (then a graduating Stanford senior) encouraged me to join The Daily, recounting on Meyer Green her own fond memories over the past four years.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward five months, and Bobby Pragada was enthusiastically convincing me to choose the sports section over a table at the activities fair.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And soon enough I had found a new, just as meaningful, ritual.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of reading about USC football with my parents, it was editing Jack Golub&#x2019;s column with him in Soto at 2 a.m., attending midweek football press conferences and walking to Treehouse to pick up pizza for production. Most nights, the routine, however, was just arguing that we print a sports article on the front page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without Claire Wang&#x2019;s willingness to take a chance on me as a freshman managing editor, I probably would not have bonded with my roommate in the same depth. My roommate played varsity lacrosse (a sport totally foreign to this Angeleno), so when tasked with editing coverage of the Stanford team, I asked her to explain the ins and outs of the sports she loved. Those conversations, with me sitting on my bed and her across the narrow dorm room on hers, or similar ones with my student-athlete friends Mason Gonzalez and Allie Jones, among others, brought us all closer over the course of the school year. Through these friendships, I forged another layer of my Stanford routine.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing and editing, especially as I assimilated to Stanford during my freshman year, gave me a sense of purpose, focus and community &#x2014; both within and beyond 456 Panama Mall. As a leader in a traditionally male section and traditionally male field at-large, perhaps the most important personal takeaway of working as a sports journalist and editor was harnessing my voice. Often the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/12\/21\/zhang-the-boys-club\/\">only woman in the room<\/a> (and probably the youngest, too), I had to advocate for myself and what I believed in. Perhaps that was construed as being insubordinate at times, but I would like to think that my presence and efforts helped other women carve out their own places in the sports journalism world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The necessity of speaking out and writing&#x2019;s potential to prompt change became especially apparent during my coverage of <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/11\/22\/36-sports-strong\/\">36 Sports Strong <\/a>and, in particular, the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/07\/13\/sports-game-point-1\/\">men&#x2019;s volleyball team&#x2019;s <\/a>efforts to save their program. Speaking to players and alumni showed me in practice the way that journalism could bring people together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But hearing about the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/07\/08\/sports-cancellations\/\">intended cuts<\/a>, simultaneous to sports around the country being put on hold <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/08\/11\/sports-football-cancelled\/\">due to the pandemic<\/a>, also made me realize how devastated I would be if a team\/club\/organization that I cared about was suddenly defunct or out of reach. More than anything, it made me appreciate the people, routines and laughs that The Daily has brought me. I&#x2019;ll take those memories with me, like the childhood photo albums, long after I leave this university &#x2014; freshman year autograph sessions after my full-page graphic on the baseball team and muddy Ink Bowl Games and headline games and Zoom Kahoots and breaking down Pac-12 football in EVGR with Daniel Martinez-Krams and interviews outside Jimmy V&#x2019;s with Zach Zafran and weekends at the beach with Tammer Bagdasarian and Cooper Veit and Drew Silva&#x2019;s NFL jerseys as we wait for TAP on Draft Day and FloVolleyball games with Madeline Grabb and trivia nights with Benjamin Zaidel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I decided at the start of my senior year that I would save a printed copy of each week&#x2019;s Stanford Daily so that, by graduation in June, I would have a journalistic record of my final year on campus. So, in packing up my undergraduate dorm room for the final time, I find myself in an oddly familiar position. Like the photograph from 20 years ago, I stand with an armful of newspapers, ready for whatever&#x2019;s next.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cybele Zhang discusses the rituals she&#8217;s found at Stanford. &#8220;Before even enrolling as a student, The Stanford Daily brought me community.

| Secrets from a girl (who\u2019s seen a little)"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>When Lorde released her third studio album, &#x201C;Solar Power,&#x201D; last August, I was underwhelmed. Like Lorde <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/08\/03\/arts\/music\/lorde-solar-power.html\">herself<\/a>, I had expected this release to be a &#x201C;big acid record&#x201D; &#x2014; showing up the synth angst of &#x201C;Pure Heroine&#x201D; and the museum magic of &#x201C;Melodrama&#x201D; with the shock and awe of a meteor shower.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, we got a first single that many found fitting for a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AbeoRobinson\/status\/1435770964516638722\">tampon commercial<\/a>. The intense instrumental breakdowns of tracks like &#x201C;Glory and Gore&#x201D; and &#x201C;Supercut&#x201D; were replaced by a leisurely 12-string guitar and a voice like farmer&#x2019;s market honey. Like its eponymous song, &#x201C;Solar Power&#x201D; instead turned out something like a &#x201C;weed album.&#x201D; It was playful. Meandering. Mild, even.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some complained that they were still too caught up in their &#x201C;Melodrama&#x201D; eras to appreciate this album, I felt like I hadn&#x2019;t even gotten past &#x201C;Pure Heroine.&#x201D; I was the overgrown suburban child who still drank orange juice and cried about growing up. Meanwhile, a 25-year-old Kiwi was telling me to get a grip. Not every song had to strike you to the bone, not every day would feel like cataclysm and not every day was a tick on a time bomb. Most of the time, Lorde seemed to say, life wasn&#x2019;t so extreme.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the kind of intense person who could never quite land the &#x201C;cool girl&#x201D; act, it was hard for me to learn to be temperate. I&#x2019;d long been familiar with debilitating grief, totalizing sadness, all-consuming infatuation; but I didn&#x2019;t know the grey emotions, the stretches between those poles.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, I spent a lot of time in grey.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scholarships I&#x2019;d poured every last drop of myself into seeped through my hands. People I&#x2019;d loved unconditionally established their conditions. Nothing on this campus felt the same as when we&#x2019;d left it, no matter how hard we tried to pretend we could refurbish a ghost town. But the sun stuck around a little longer. The music returned. It wasn&#x2019;t miraculous, but we found our footing again.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Granted, long-term memory and I aren&#x2019;t on the best of terms, but it&#x2019;s impossible to locate a few favorite senior year memories. It didn&#x2019;t feel like that&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;moments of sorrow, then moments of elation. It felt like ballooning into new spaces between all those words that used to classify then, now, later.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used to think that anything good had to be tumultuous. I wanted art to arrest me, and I wanted to feel <em>everything. <\/em>Senior year was supposed to pack all the punch of a swig of Italian liquor. Perhaps to spite me, it instead took notes from &#x201C;Solar Power,&#x201D; which I&#x2019;m now growing to love.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had spent so long curating chaos in my life to accommodate my obsessive need for melodrama, but as it turns out, resisting getting older gets old.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#x2019;s actually quite beautiful to realize that adolescent turbulence is not a prerequisite for feeling alive. You don&#x2019;t have to be fundamentally altered by something for it to be good for you. You don&#x2019;t have to seek catharsis in every sunset. You don&#x2019;t have to milk every second for what it&#x2019;s worth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#x2019;ve never claimed to be wise, and I certainly won&#x2019;t do so now. But if there&#x2019;s anything I wish I would&#x2019;ve understood sooner, it was that my life doesn&#x2019;t have to have a perpetual coming-of-age-film ethos to mean something. I&#x2019;m going to be &#x201C;becoming&#x201D; forever, long past the expiration dates the entertainment industry loves setting for women, and long past the lingering sense of loss I still feel now. I&#x2019;m going to experience as much stillness as I will tumultuousness, and both will matter.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I sat &#x2014; pen and pad in hand and seat heater on &#x2014; at my first San Francisco movie premiere freshman year, I remember thinking how surreal it was to be a student journalist. As I wobbled in a rickety swivel chair at the Daily building typing and retyping print headlines years later, I remember thinking the same thing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just because a moment isn&#x2019;t glamorous doesn&#x2019;t mean it won&#x2019;t glisten, and when I shuffle through my memories of this place, I see a luminous haze.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Malia Mendez reflects on her time at Stanford. &#8220;It\u2019s actually quite beautiful to realize that adolescent turbulence is not a prerequisite for feeling alive.

a Stanford edtech startup reimagines the expertise economy"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Although the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2019\/06\/07\/former-sailing-coach-expected-to-face-13-month-prison-sentence\/\">Varsity Blues<\/a> scandal stigmatized the field of &#x2018;academic coaching&#x2019;, demand for assistance in applications at all stages of life &#x2014;&#xA0;from college to graduate school to employment &#x2014; remains significant. Disparities in information between those accepted and those aspiring to be revealed an opportunity for John Koelliker MBA &#x2019;22.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help people &#x201C;monetize what they know,&#x201D; Koelliker founded Leland, an edtech startup that raised a $4M seed round from Contrary in May, following their $1M pre-seed round last July.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although academic and professional consulting is a well-established industry, Leland differentiates itself from the competition by serving as an accessible marketplace and supportive community for those seeking and offering coaching services, according to Koelliker. Leland initially started out specializing in MBA admissions, but recently announced its expansion into test prep and career development. It ultimately seeks to make its platform a source of long-term support for its clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#xA0;&#x201C;Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re someone about to be an undergrad. We can connect you to a leading coach to help you get into college,&#x201D; said Emma Casey &#x2018;25, a current product management intern at Leland. &#x201C;A few years down the line, when you&#8217;re looking to get your first internship, we can also connect you to a coach that will help you think about what type of roles you want to do. Maybe five years later, we can help you connect to someone that will guide you through the law school application or the MBA application process.&#x201D;&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Casey says she is particularly excited about the energy that the startup and its community have created, including an active Slack of 350+ people supporting each other&#x2019;s ambitions and journeys. Victor Charoonsophonsak, a Leland client recently admitted into Stanford&#x2019;s MBA program, agreed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I come from a background where my friends, family, and peers had not attended prestigious MBA programs, so I didn&#8217;t know who to reach out to for help,&#x201D; Charoonsophonsak wrote. &#x201C;Leland provided me with a community of people who empathized with me and empowered me to pull together my best application possible.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While coaching has historically been siloed off for the highly privileged, the people at Leland are looking to make coaching more accessible. Erika Mahterian, an early Leland hire and current Head of Experience, said that her &#x201C;number one reason for joining the company was that [she] always had a passion for accessibility to education resources and leveling the playing field.&#x201D;&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leland currently offers a variety of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.joinleland.com\/small-group-classes\">small group classes<\/a>, which range in price from $25 to $60. Users pay an hourly rate for individual sessions and can identify their desired price range when identifying a coach. Coaches in the &#8220;low&#8221; price range charge below $150\/hour, while those in the &#8220;medium&#8221; and &#8220;high&#8221; ranges charge between $151-$250 and above $250, respectively.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, Mahterian said that Leland&#x2019;s coaching marketplace is a product with &#x201C;immense potential for equalizing educational and career outcomes.&#8221; Grace Chen, a recent MBA admit and Leland customer, said that Leland coaches prioritized her needs over profits.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;My coach was super direct with feedback and would tell me not to spend that much on services if I didn&#x2019;t need them,&#x201D; Chen said.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Casey said Leland&#x2019;s plans for the future will include continuing to match people with personalized help through providing their core product &#x2014;&nbsp;&#x201C;one-on-one coaching and small group classes.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike Mella, an early project manager at Leland, echoed the importance of the mission for the company&#8217;s future. He said one of the most fulfilling parts of his experience has been &#x201C;watching clients transition into coaches&#x201D; in a very short timespan.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Leland, an academic and professional coaching startup founded by John Koelliker at the Stanford GSB, had its $4M seed round on May 11.

remote exams for students in isolation ahead of the final exam period during Thursday&#x2019;s Faculty Senate meeting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The meeting comes after Stanford <a href=\"https:\/\/healthalerts.stanford.edu\/covid-19\/covid-dashboard\/\">reported<\/a> 475 COVID-19 cases on campus on Tuesday. The University also <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/05\/29\/move-out-is-approaching-here-is-what-you-should-do-if-you-test-positive-for-covid-19\/\">announced<\/a> on Friday that students with housing contracts ending in mid-June who test positive for COVID-19 &#x200B;&#x200B;between May 31 and move-out day are still expected to move out of their residence on time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of Tuesday, <a href=\"https:\/\/healthalerts.stanford.edu\/covid-19\/covid-dashboard\/\">305 students<\/a> are isolating, and many of them may not test out in time to take final exams in person.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some students in isolation are circulating emails on social media from instructors who will not allow students to take final exams online. In one email, an instructor reportedly gave the isolating student two options: have their grade calculated with a zero on the final exam or take an incomplete in the course until they could take the final exam next academic year. The Daily reached out to the University for comment regarding the authenticity of the emails.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The School of Humanities and Sciences and other University schools and departments have received emails from many students urging for accommodations given the ongoing pandemic, according to Satz.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;In some cases, students who cannot take an in-person exam find themselves in a position where they have to wait a full year in order to take a makeup exam in-person,&#x201D; Satz said. As a result of expressed student concerns, Satz&#x2019; office has been meeting with faculty &#x201C;to share the students&#8217; concerns and to strongly encourage increased flexibility,&#x201D; she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Satz has emailed the department chairs in the School of Humanities and Sciences, urging them to implement a remote exam option for students who are in isolation, according to her. Though some professors have already started designing remote exams, concerns remain about how remote exam options can preserve academic integrity, she added.<br><br>&#x201C;If remote exams are offered and we do find increases in cheating in such contexts, cheating isn&#x2019;t only an Honor Code violation affecting the cheater, it also affects fairness in grading,&#x201D; she said.<br><br>The Board on Judicial Affairs&#x2019; <a href=\"https:\/\/communitystandards.stanford.edu\/policies-guidance\/bja-guidance-definitions-and-clarifications\/guidance-exams-students-red\">current guidance<\/a> on remote exams as it relates to the Honor Code states that &#x201C;in-person exams may be administered simultaneously to students with a red Health Check badge using the same instructions as in-person exams,&#x201D; meaning that exams provided to students with red Health Check badges could either be open-resource or closed-book depending on the instructions of the in-person exams.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Faculty Senate also condemned the May 24 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2022\/05\/25\/us\/victims-uvalde-texas-school-shooting\/index.html\">mass shooting<\/a> of 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.<br><br>In light of the shooting, theater and performance studies professor Branislav Jakovljevic asked Marc Tessier-Lavigne if Stanford&#x2019;s leadership planned to &#x201C;reconsider its relationship&#x201D; with &#x201C;opponents of gun regulation&#x201D; associated with the Hoover Institution.<br><br>&#x201C;I personally abhor the horrific gun violence we&#8217;ve seen in our country, both, as you say in the recent tragic incidents over the past few weeks and even the past few days, but also in similar events that have occurred over the longer term,&#x201D; Tessier-Lavigne said. &#x201C; Our own University policy is that guns are prohibited on campus. Beyond that, the University does not take an institutional position on the appropriate level or means of gun regulation.&#x201D;<br><br>In other business, the Senate approved a proposal from the Committee on Undergraduate Standards and Policy to enable part-time enrollment status for coterm students, expand Cardinal Service and allow credit for military training and service work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Senate also moved to approve changes to the <a href=\"https:\/\/doresearch.stanford.edu\/policies\/research-policy-handbook\">Research Policy Handbook<\/a> after the revisions were <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/04\/08\/faculty-senate-tables-changes-on-conflict-of-interest-and-commitment-policy\/\">tabled<\/a> at an April meeting. Law professor and Acting Vice Provost for Research David Studdert and Associate Vice Provost for Research Policy and Integrity Cindy Kiel reviewed proposed changes to the fourth section of the handbook pertaining to conflicts of interest and commitment.<br><br>The proposed changes crystallize that commitments and activities undertaken by faculty and staff beyond the scope of their responsibilities at Stanford require prior institutional approval. The revisions come at the heels of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2022\/04\/07\/1091090565\/feng-franklin-tao-china-initiative-university-of-kansas\">high-profile arrests<\/a> and political pressure targeting American academics with undisclosed conflicts involving foreign governments.<br><br>Although the motion passed, some members of the Faculty Senate expressed their concerns about the privacy and safety of faculty members under these new changes, questioning the need to expand pre-existing supervision of faculty on conflicts of interest.<br><br>&#x201C;Why impose sweeping and ill-advised administrative remedies when judicious response to any individual problems has been and is available?&#x201D; asked psychiatry and behavioral sciences professor David Spiegel, who served on the School of Medicine&#x2019;s Conflict of Interest committee for a decade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;This is disrespectful and demeaning to our faculty, devaluing our primary asset as an institution,&#x201D; Spiegel added. &#x201C;The existing policy, which is good, focused on the values it was trying to protect.

But he couldn&#x2019;t stay for long.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 8 a.m. the next morning, Fields was on the road, speeding west on Interstate 10 with his family and belongings in tow. His first classes in Stanford&#x2019;s Management Science and Engineering (MS&amp;E) program were starting in just four days.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 26-hour drive from San Antonio to Palo Alto was the final leg of Fields&#x2019; journey to Stanford. But the itinerary had been set a long time ago. Starting in high school, Fields dreamed bigger than he thought a kid from Tulsa, Okla. could. He wanted to break barriers for his family. He wanted to play in the NFL. And he wanted to give back to Tulsa along the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I feel like I&#8217;ve been moving 1,000 miles an hour since I don&#8217;t even know how long,&#x201D; Fields said. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s a lot of stuff in my life that doesn&#8217;t really get highlighted because football is the biggest attention grabber.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#x2019;s plenty of reason to be excited about Fields&#x2019; football. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a veteran safety with three Big 12 Championships and two College Football Playoff semifinals under his belt, he brings the kind of experience a floundering Stanford program desperately needs. When he suits up for the Cardinal next fall, Fields will fulfill one of his biggest childhood dreams.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the late nights and early mornings Fields spent getting to Stanford brought him a lot more, too. He arrives on the Farm with a master&#x2019;s degree in accounting, an offer from McKinsey and plans to organize education and mentorship programs for Tulsa&#x2019;s schools. As his final season of college football looms, Fields still has many more dreams ahead of him.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those dreams started when Fields was young. Growing up in Tulsa, the common fantasy of playing college football for Oklahoma played in his head. He grew up watching the Sooners and re-enacted his favorite plays in his living room, somersaulting into an imaginary endzone.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going to Stanford wasn&#x2019;t on the radar at first. Fields excelled in class and kept a high GPA, but he saw few Black students around him apply to top colleges. His outlook changed when his older brother was admitted to Cornell.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Once I saw him do that, [it] kind of broke the barriers for not only himself but our family and, you know, kids that look like us at our school,&#x201D; Fields said. &#x201C;It opened me up to that world.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It helped that Fields always seemed to have a preternatural focus. Once he set goals, he saw them through. He didn&#x2019;t have qualms about taking classes through his summers or missing prom to graduate early from high school in December. When he was younger, he sought out odd jobs and errands when the family budget was tight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;He&#8217;s always been very conscious of responsibility,&#x201D; said Serina, Fields&#x2019; mother. &#x201C;As a young child, he wanted to get certain things and, with me being a single mom, I wasn&#8217;t always able to do it. He would mow lawns or he would do little jobs, like help out at the games.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fields settled on Stanford as his top choice to play in college, and he had the numbers in class and on the field to catch head coach David Shaw&#x2019;s interest. But he&#x2019;d moved too quickly through his studies for even Stanford. The Cardinal program wasn&#x2019;t accepting graduates from high school who wanted to enroll in college early &#x2014; a policy that Stanford only <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2021\/01\/12\/stanford-football-announces-first-ever-early-enrollees\/\">recently changed<\/a> in 2021 &#x2014; making Fields&#x2019; recruitment a non-starter. Oklahoma, meanwhile, was the first school to offer him. That was too hard to turn down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Obviously, that&#x2019;s my home school,&#x201D; Fields said. &#x201C;A lot of love there. But I was very passionate about going to Stanford and had everything worked out &#x2014; I think I would&#x2019;ve definitely come to Stanford before OU.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Playing for the Sooners, though, threw Fields head first into championship football. As a freshman in 2018, Fields watched quarterback Kyler Murray win the Heisman and power Oklahoma to a Big 12 Championship and a CFP semifinal. Fields first received extended playing time in that semifinal &#x2014; a shootout against No. 1 Alabama in the Orange Bowl &#x2014; after coming off the bench to replace an injured starter. He grew from there, starting at safety on the Sooners&#x2019; defense for the next three years.&#xA0;&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I have so much appreciation for everything I got to experience there,&#x201D; Fields said. &#x201C;There&#8217;s a reason why they&#8217;re one of the greatest college football programs of all time.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Off the gridiron, Fields kept to the breakneck academic schedule he had in high school. He was already set on his next goal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I told myself as a freshman, I want to grad transfer to Stanford,&#x201D; Fields said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That meant setting himself up to graduate early again. To make things harder, Fields chose to ferry himself through an accelerated bachelor&#8217;s and master&#8217;s program in accounting. The dual degree normally takes five years to complete. Fields wanted to be done by the first semester of his senior year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The requirements for Stanford&#x2019;s MS&amp;E program added yet another burden. Fields needed a Ph.D. economics class to fulfill a math prerequisite, but the class met during morning practice, so he watched the lectures in the evenings. It was usually around 8 p.m. when he made it home, where he&#x2019;d spend an hour reading to his younger cousin before starting his work. The only thing Fields didn&#x2019;t keep track of was his sleep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I [was] falling asleep maybe at 10 o&#x2019;clock,&#x201D; Fields said, before pausing to reconsider. &#x201C;Nah, I never fell asleep at ten. I probably slept three to five hours during the season.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Somehow, Fields&#x2019; schedule paid off. He completed his accounting degree in December of his senior year and was accepted into Stanford&#x2019;s MS&amp;E program &#x2014; and, as a graduate school applicant to Stanford, Fields wasn&#x2019;t recruited by Stanford&#x2019;s football program during the application. He ended his final season with the Sooners on a high note, too: Fields&#x2019; final play in Oklahoma Memorial Stadium was a game-sealing interception against Iowa State, and he earned Defensive MVP honors at the Alamo Bowl for a ten-tackle effort in the season-ending win.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fields was still sore from those tackles when he set off on the long drive to Stanford&#x2019;s campus, and he barely had time to get his bearings before classes began. Fields had only been to California once before, for a road game against UCLA. Now, five months after arriving at Stanford, he&#x2019;s still taking everything in.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s just like, suddenly my life feels fake,&#x201D; Fields said. &#x201C;Seeing palm trees&#x2026; Going to the beach is like the biggest thing in the world.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stanford&#x2019;s football program seems just as excited to have Fields. Head coach David Shaw expects him to compete immediately for playing time, even amongst an experienced defensive back room that counts as one of the strengths of the Cardinal&#x2019;s roster. He also sees Fields as a valuable leader.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Our first couple of conversations had everything to do with, &#x2018;Hey, what&#8217;s my role? How much do you want me to push? How much do you want me to lead you know, who are the guys I wanted to touch base with?&#x2019;&#x201D; Shaw said. &#x201C;He naturally wants to lead.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fields is fitting well into the culture of a Stanford program that, by his observation, is big on player leadership and developing players&#x2019; football IQ. Oklahoma, by contrast, felt &#x201C;old school in a lot of ways,&#x201D; Fields said. &#x201C;Stuff was simple. We were gonna push sleds, run fast, lift heavy weights&#x2026; our practices were very intense, like crazy.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;He kind of has a different mentality,&#x201D; said fifth-year wide receiver Michael Wilson. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s used to winning &#x2026; because that&#8217;s all he knows at OU.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fields will have three college degrees by the time he wraps up his college football career, but playing in the NFL is still his next goal. His perspective on football has changed significantly since childhood, however. In Tulsa, football used to feel like the only option available to him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I thought that was the only way you could have a great life,&#x201D; Fields said of the sport. &#x201C;Football was a big motivator simply from that standpoint, wanting to change things for myself, my family [and] my future family.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, Fields plays football purely out of passion, he says. And while that&#x2019;s enough to push him to aim for the pros, he&#x2019;s just as excited about the paths he&#x2019;ll take after football. Fields might be the only prospective NFL player next year to declare for the draft with an offer from consulting firm McKinsey in his back pocket &#x2014; Fields applied while at Oklahoma, and he can accept whenever he hangs up his cleats &#x2014; and, eventually, he hopes to bring his earnings from both football and business back to his hometown.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;&#x200B;&#x200B;Hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to open up some type of mentorship program in Tulsa,&#x201D; Fields said. &#x201C;I just want to expose inner city kids to coding, computer science, tech &#x2026; all these things that people typically don&#x2019;t get any exposure to because of lack of funding.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Fields, it&#x2019;s a way to give back. He speaks gratefully about the mentorship he received at Oklahoma &#x2014; he didn&#x2019;t know what a resume or a cover letter was when he arrived, he recalls, and a staff member in student affairs took him to a sale at JC Penny to buy his first suit.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While at Oklahoma, Fields ran a financial literacy seminar for high school students and established a &#8220;Black Wall Street Scholarship&#8221; for lower-income students from Tulsa looking to go to OU. He plans to return home again this summer to organize a bigger event on Juneteenth, which will connect high school athletes with Stanford college admissions staff and Black professionals in various industries.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#x2019;s what Fields would have loved to have seen growing up himself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I wish I would have seen more representation of successful minority leaders, entrepreneurs, businessmen,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;The only way I thought I could make it was football.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It took several hectic years, two degrees and countless late nights, but Fields has proven that belief wrong. He&#x2019;s proud of how far he&#x2019;s come. With a year of football at his dream school ahead of him and several impassioned paths to choose from whenever his playing career ends, Fields might have finally earned himself a full night&#x2019;s sleep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I&#8217;m just fortunate to be in the position I am today,&#x201D; Fields said. &#x201C;I can be fearless.&#x201D;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When fifth year safety Patrick Fields suits up for his first game for Stanford, he will realize a dream.

Wade <\/em>in the leaked Supreme Court draft of <em>Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x2019;s Health Organization<\/em>. The letter has amassed over 200 signatures from law students, student organizations, professors and attorneys.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Supreme Court is expected to release their final decision in <em>Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x2019;s Health Organization<\/em> in mid-to-late June. A leaked draft opinion indicates the Court&#8217;s decision will overturn the landmark case <em>Roe v. Wade<\/em>, which protects individuals from state bans on abortions. While it is possible for any of the justices in the majority to change their decision, none have changed their minds so far, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2022\/05\/11\/alito-abortion-draft-opinion-roe-00031648\">according to Politico<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;We thought about sending it to the court directly,&#x201D; Tessa Silverman, a first-year law student at SLS and incoming ACS President for the SLS Chapter said. &#x201C;But at the end of the day, we&#8217;re realistic about the fact that this kind of letter is probably not going to change Clarence Thomas&#8217; mind, even if he receives it directly.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, Silverman hopes the message of the letter defending reproductive rights will be there &#x201C;when people are looking back on this as a particularly dark moment in the Supreme Court&#8217;s trajectory.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The letter was constructed by various American Constitution Society (ACS) collegiate chapters. In addition to SLS, ACS chapters at University of Hawaii Law School, North Carolina Central University Law School, and Georgetown Law School helped in the creation of this letter.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ACS advocates for interpreting the Constitution &#x201C;based on its text and against the backdrop of history and lived experience,&#x201D; according to its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.acslaw.org\/about-us\/\">website<\/a>. The letter addressing the leaked draft is not an official statement of the formal ACS organization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blake Phillips of Georgetown Law School believes that &#x201C;this [letter] is just supposed to be the start of a broader conversation.&#x201D; He shared that the coalition is looking to engage with others. &#x201C;The most important one is to just listen to the reproductive justice folks that have been doing this work on the ground for decades,&#x201D; Phillips said.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Phillips, the possibility of <em>Roe v. Wade <\/em>being overturned, is &#x201C;not just morally wrong, that it&#x2019;s not just societally wrong, that it&#x2019;s not just what most Americans disagree with, but that it&#x2019;s legally that there are really, really dangerous things that this Dobbs&#x2019; opinion says.&#x201D;&#xA0;According to him, the decision would go against long-held conventional legal wisdom and would put the grounds used to uphold numerous other cases in question.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Danielle Bell, a third-year law student at the University of Hawaii explained that state-level activism will be imperative for reproductive rights in case <em>Roe <\/em>is overturned, explaining &#x201C;voters can help shape access to abortion by carefully considering their elected judges.&#x201D;&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Broader implications of the case, also spurred Bell&#x2019;s involvement with the coalition. When she heard about Justice Alito&#x2019;s draft opinion, it felt as &#x201C;one more step away from democracy.&#x201D;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Supreme Court is expected to release their final decision in Dobbs v.

Jones said. &#x201C;If you can play, you can play anywhere.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before he made waves as a sharpshooter for an accomplished Davidson program, Jones started his basketball career in the basement of his home in Minnesota.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Growing up, my basement in my house was unfinished, so it was just like a concrete slab,&#x201D; Jones said. &#x201C;So my dad and I put a little mini basketball hoop up and I would go down there when I was really young, like four or five years old.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His early affinity for the game ultimately served him well &#x2014; the 6-foot-5 guard found success beyond just the basement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jones comes to The Farm with an impressive resume at the collegiate level. After redshirting his first year at Davidson, the Minnesota native demonstrated his efficient production in the subsequent three seasons, shooting above 44% from the field each year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His time as a Wildcat culminated with a 2021-22 campaign in which he started all 34 games, scoring an average of 11.8 points in each while shooting 42.1% from beyond the arc. Jones&#x2019; play helped Davidson earn an Atlantic-10 regular season championship as well as an NCAA Tournament appearance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the guard has earned a reputation as a shooter, he knows he brings a lot more to the table.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Especially this past year, I think I&#x2019;m a much-improved defender,&#x201D; said Jones, who corralled a career-best 33 steals last season. &#x201C;I think I have good vision, good passing, [am] able to make good decisions with the ball [and] playmake a little bit.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jones&#x2019; improvements on the defensive end will prove to be especially valuable for a Stanford team that allowed opponents to shoot 45% from the field last season, second worst in the Pac-12. His offensive skill set should also improve the flow of a Cardinal offense that was hurt by moments of stagnation and cold shooting spells.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Michael provides a tremendous skill set,&#8221; said head coach Jerod Haase in a <a href=\"https:\/\/gostanford.com\/news\/2022\/5\/25\/mens-basketball-jones-joins-as-grad-transfer.aspx\">press release<\/a>. &#8220;He can score in a variety of ways and can defend multiple positions. He played an integral role on an NCAA Tournament team and will provide experience that will immediately lift our program.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With his NCAA tournament experience, the career 40.3% 3-point shooter hopes to lead the Cardinal into territory that they have not entered in years &#x2014; the program has failed to reach the NCAA Tournament since 2014.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I think we have a chance to be a really good team this year [and] go to the tournament,&#x201D; Jones said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Jones will likely be asked to provide outside shooting and perimeter defense &#x2014; both staples of Haase&#8217;s system in recent years &#x2014; the transfer&#x2019;s contributions in the locker room will be less familiar as he will be the program&#8217;s first transfer since 2009.&#xA0;Despite joining as a new member of the team, Jones has a plan for providing his veteran presence, largely thanks to the impact a transfer player had on him while at Davidson.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Part of the reason our team was so good is that we had a transfer ourselves, Foster Loyer,&#x201D; Jones said of his Davidson squad from the 2021-22 season. &#x201C;He was a leader, somebody who guys looked up to. And that&#x2019;s what I hope I can be. This coming year in the locker room I&#x2019;m not trying to be anything crazy, just be who I am&#x2026;I like to think I know basketball pretty well, so hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to spread a little bit of my wisdom that I&#8217;ve had over my career to any of the guys.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After finishing 16-16 last season, the Stanford squad has its sights set on winning. And Michael Jones is confident he can make that happen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I&#8217;m a winner and we&#8217;re going to win. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to say.&#x201D;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For the first time since 2009, the Stanford men&#8217;s basketball team will welcome a transfer:

circle of van life"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>&#x201C;If I were to ever get a tattoo, it would be <em>jugaad<\/em>.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hindi word <em>jugaad<\/em> roughly translates to a &#x201C;hack&#x201D; &#x2014; a flexible approach to problem-solving founded on frugality and creativity. Think: a plastic water bottle poked with holes to mimic a shower head. Although Kayla Huemer M.S. &#x2019;22 first learned the term <em>jugaad <\/em>during the summer of 2016 while working in a biomechanics lab at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, India, she&#x2019;d been dedicated to it her whole life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As children, Huemer and her sister Kiara &#x2014; two years her junior &#x2014; regularly transformed their suburban Wisconsin backyard into the sleepy woodland of Disney&#x2019;s &#x201C;Pocahontas,&#x201D; scampering through mud and assigning secondary roles to their friends. In the sisters&#x2019; teen years, Kiara underwent an emergency surgery that precluded her from swimming during a trip to their grandparents&#x2019; lake house, so Huemer suggested they instead spend the weekend painting their Toyota Echo. Weeks later, the acrylic colors they&#x2019;d used smudged in the rain, so Huemer turned the remnants into a tie-dye pattern.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;She can see things like that,&#x201D; Kiara says. &#x201C;She&#x2019;s like an inventor &#x2014; she always has been.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Huemer, engineering is about working with what you have. That&#x2019;s why <em>jugaad <\/em>became the focus of her accepted Stanford entrance essay, the title of her <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCjyStOzw-uhioD0Y1Wm8MOQ\/videos\">YouTube channel<\/a> and the license plate of her camper van &#x2014; which she drove from St. Louis to Stanford before beginning the second year of her master&#x2019;s program in the summer of 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">***<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When she boarded the AmTrak train from Chicago to Stanford in the fall of 2020, Huemer had imagined Stanford as a cinematic, West Coast dreamscape. Instead, she found a ghost town. At the time, only graduate students were permitted to live on campus. The COVID-19 pandemic had turned the once-bustling Tresidder Memorial Union into a vast, vacant space. Meyer Green went untouched.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Huemer flirted with the idea of buying, gutting and renovating a camper van for the entire first year of her master&#x2019;s. But, that spring, when she secured a remote internship for the summer of 2021, Huemer&#x2019;s search became serious. She spent hours each day doom-scrolling through Craigslist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She passed on heaps of 12K skoolies and fully furnished Airstreams before she stumbled upon Deb Mutchler&#x2019;s 2013 Ford Transit Connect. The ad was text-only, so Huemer messaged Mutchler for photos. Even with the pixelation, she could see a few dents, some rusting on the fender. But it was baby blue, inconspicuous, and 3k under book &#x2014; promising enough for the first solo odyssey she&#x2019;d attempt that summer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She advanced $300 into Mutchler&#x2019;s son&#x2019;s bank account in late spring, then flew to St. Louis in June. To close the deal, Mutchler shoveled out maintenance records and Huemer put up the rest of the cash. Then Huemer drove off &#x2014; but not before Mutchler snapped a farewell picture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/_ueyX1w4gj8JSYHnAhLUjmEAKyih1AQi76Gqtf89LlxT8nfFNBmkE9XcgrheD0Nu4S_MqSfR-3CH5mKWVtPad8IrtLwIvCnNKI_bxKGFePA0Bxb-ywM5lhQRAeMVihaiFss8fexd-aLv-waJJQ\" alt=\"Huemer stands in front of the van next to Mutchler with her dog\" \/><figcaption><em>Courtesy of Kayla Huemer<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;It just got really sentimental,&#x201D; Huemer said. &#x201C;I think the reality of it hit her.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mutchler was indeed weathering the grief of losing a friend she&#x2019;d spent 22 years and 120,000 miles with, but she felt at peace entrusting Huemer with the van.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;She has spunk. Spark. And determination to grow herself in a very independent and driven way,&#x201D; Mutchler said. &#x201C;Robotics are not for sissies.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the rest of that summer, Huemer lived with her grandmother in Green Bay, working her remote job as an Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Consultant with Medtronic Labs by day and renovating the van &#x2014; which she named &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/murphy_mobile_\/\">Murphy<\/a>,&#x201D;&#xA0; from &#x201C;Murphy&#x2019;s Law&#x201D;&#xA0; &#x2014; by night.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 2014 film &#x201C;Interstellar,&#x201D; the protagonist&#x2019;s daughter is named Murph, also after Murphy&#x2019;s Law. At one point, Murph frustratedly asks her father, &#x201C;Why did you and Mom name me after something that&#x2019;s bad?&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Well, we didn&#x2019;t,&#x201D; he replies. &#x201C;Murphy&#x2019;s Law doesn&#x2019;t mean something bad is gonna happen. What it means is that whatever can happen, will happen.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Huemer told her parents she was going to build out a camper van and drive it, alone, from Green Bay, up and down the east coast and back to Stanford, she consoled them by framing Murphy&#x2019;s Law this way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;If anything that can happen will happen,&#x201D; she told them, &#x201C;then, in a way, anything that can go right, will go right.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And late that August, one month before she&#x2019;d begin the second and last year of her master&#x2019;s, Huemer set out from Green Bay praying she was right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>House-hopping from one old friend to another, Huemer balanced peaceful time alone in the van with the amenities of stationary dwellings. She could pray as loudly and as long as she liked alone with Murphy, then refuel with a warm shower and a crisp Kombucha cocktail before doing it all over again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This wasn&#x2019;t a mere tour, though &#x2014; it was a pilgrimage. Huemer had created an itinerary that dropped her in Colorado&#x2019;s Great Sand Dunes by Sept. 8, when GUTTED, a five-day vehicle renovation competition turned reality TV show, began.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those five days, Huemer collected electrical scraps from neighboring camps and cheered on her favorite celebrity van-lifer, Linnea Schmelzer, another solo female van-lifer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I loved being behind the scenes,&#x201D; Huemer said. She&#x2019;d missed the building phase since she&#x2019;d left her grandmother&#x2019;s home in Green Bay, so she indulged in supporting others through it &#x2014; and tweaking Murphy along the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/AhdTCYzLhWnNJAgHJwrrcUFNgevzs-m-SM5fsbTxN_By1Ao33z2G2XtDkK5CGUT10mVgCfaL7-xcgmkYknxaq-8l3pYy_QOPnchA8_Qrkd852NuXb3nBlrIkWysMIyJ121wPsI69LY08PX9z6Q\" alt=\"Huemer stands on a dirt road, smiling and pointing to the van beside her\" \/><figcaption><em>Courtesy of Kayla Huemer<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple days into the competition, Huemer spotted a duo excising connectors from a dozen yards worth of LED strips.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Are you throwing this out?&#x201D; she asked, delicately. &#x201C;Can I use it?&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I mean, go ahead, but you&#x2019;re only going to be able to use it if you know how to solder,&#x201D; they said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Huemer smirked. For a biomedical engineer like herself, soldering an LED strip would be like a synchronized swimmer treading water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When she&#x2019;d restored the LED lights to their former glory, Huemer lined them below the exhibit of state park posters that dotted Murphy&#x2019;s interior. Under the soft light, her adaptable bed morphed into an Airbnb nest. Across from this nook, a wooden countertop housed her foldable kitchenette and doubled as an extra bed frame. Watching Huemer expand and contract the van feels like watching a Transformer in action. Murphy, &#x201C;dented on the outside but beautified on the inside,&#x201D; thoroughly embodies <em>jugaad<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back at Stanford in the fall of 2021, Huemer anxiously awaited an opportunity to get back on the road &#x2014; this time, living completely out of Murphy. Despite her infatuation with van life, for Huemer, school would always come first, so she couldn&#x2019;t up and go whenever she pleased.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then Stanford announced that the first two weeks of winter quarter would be conducted remotely. Students were still allowed to return to campus &#x2014; a relief to many who&#x2019;d long surpassed their tolerance for their hometowns &#x2014; but classes would be held on Zoom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;While this news may come as a disappointment to many, we hope you will find ways to embrace the &#x2018;remote learning&#x2019; environment,&#x201D; the University email read. Many students shuddered at the news, but a spirit of <em>jugaad<\/em> moved Huemer to think otherwise. This was her opening.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In early January, she departed from her Palo Alto co-op Box of Rain with her class schedule, a Verizon wireless coverage map and a rough road trip itinerary. Her heathered knit and turquoise earrings blended into Murphy&#x2019;s blue-gray interior.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;[There were] so many bumps in the road,&#x201D; Huemer said. &#x201C;My water tank broke on my first day, and it just like seeped into the sand. And I was like, &#x2018;Well, that&#x2019;s all I got.&#x2019;&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her misfortune had felt catastrophic, but an evening drugstore trip and a cotton candy sunrise later, all was calm again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During Huemer&#x2019;s twelve days on the road, other hiccups tumbled in like the Pacific Ocean tide, but <em>jugaad<\/em> meant there was always an answer. When she ran out of 5G hotspot data, she began taking Zoom calls from Starbucks parking lots. When spots weren&#x2019;t secluded enough for her to avoid passersby, she swept her blackout curtains across the windows and put Murphy in sleep-mode. When the solar wattage couldn&#x2019;t fuel a burner, she ate nonperishables.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, she&#x2019;d spent 12 days on the road, hiked 24.6 miles, used 27.5 GB of mobile data, driven 1,712 miles and taken enough photos to relive it all in her mind, over and over again. One day, she hopes to replicate the trip for real.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">***<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, Huemer has chosen to put van life on pause. This fall, she will start her new job as a project manager with a global health arm of Medtronic Labs in Kenya. She&#x2019;ll leave Murphy with a trustworthy cousin, eager to return to the U.S. and embark on new roving adventures next year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/cemw6QjfKSetY-h648GpWoltQTnKkwT0SCO9VweNFQauogYwjFztNxvdnQQkW9p183YBy4b-Udx93b_bgYU4x9RkbVA9b-EsnMwXN-LAfVdUYbJzzwrI1H9IHbOhFRdm5K9UwCECwbYkq2KDpQ\" alt=\"Huemer and Zhong sit atop the van against a scenic landscape and setting sun\" \/><figcaption><em>Courtesy of <em>Kayla Huemer<\/em><\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Before she leaves, though, Huemer will help her friend and second-year physics Ph.D. candidate Janet Zhong, build out a camper van of her own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;There will be lots of traces of Kayla in the van,&#x201D; Zhong said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a long time, Huemer couldn&#x2019;t imagine a life away from Murphy, away from the infinite California highways, away from everyone she&#x2019;d grown to love in the last two years. In many ways, moving to Kenya meant demolishing the life she&#x2019;d built here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But passing the torch to Zhong has helped her see that not all will be laid to waste. Zhong anticipates others who will help her build out her van this summer will soon embark on Craigslist hunts of their own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#x2019;t the end for Huemer and Murphy, Huemer now knows.

Despite receiving founding gifts totaling $1.7 billion, the school&#x2019;s incoming dean has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/05\/04\/climate\/john-doerr-stanford-climate.html\">indicated that<\/a> the school would still work with and accept funding from fossil fuel companies. This openness to fossil fuel funding is not hypothetical: the Doerr School is <a href=\"https:\/\/fossilfreeacademia.com\/bigoilentanglements\">currently slated to absorb<\/a> numerous fossil fuel-funded programs currently housed in the Stanford School of Earth. Such funding poses serious reputational risks to Stanford and the Doerr School, which might <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S221462962100476X?casa_token=4Jjiot_jMh8AAAAA:uQjdgsBx1DHDXcPW_MVJBlX210LfDvwuUHijypEWj2wmvZmDJAw-wUsUjG-nMFvukBdv-ONG_eM\">have its name used<\/a> to promote climate denial, greenwashing and policies that delay climate action. In response to this criticism, Dean Arun Majumdar <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.stanford.edu\/news\/message-arun-majumdar-looking-forward\">elaborated<\/a> that climate change requires an &#x201C;all hands on deck approach.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although this approach might appear reasonable, it would be prudent to verify whether fossil fuel companies are indeed honest deckhands or, instead, mutineers. After all, fossil fuel producers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.climatechangecommunication.org\/america-misled\/\">have known<\/a> about fossil-derived CO<sub>2<\/sub> emissions <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41558-018-0349-9\">since the 1950s<\/a>, and have denied or downplayed climate change <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1080\/09644016.2020.1863703\">since 1980<\/a>. In fact, the industry has used Stanford&#x2019;s name to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/12\/05\/opinion\/IHT-big-ambitions-at-stanford-a-global-climate-and-energy-project.html\">suggest<\/a> that fossil fuels are essential to sustain growth while avoiding economic disaster. Furthermore, in 2006, then-CEO of ExxonMobil Rex Tillerson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2006\/03\/30\/business\/the-new-face-of-an-oil-giant.html\">cited a $100 million contribution to Stanford&#x2019;s Global Climate and Energy Project<\/a> as evidence that the company is investing in renewable research, while ExxonMobil also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/11\/21\/us\/exxon-led-group-is-giving-a-climate-grant-to-stanford.html\">told investors<\/a> it would dedicate 1000 times more funds over the same time period to searching for new oil and gas reserves.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These seven decades of history are not lost on Dean Majumdar, who <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.stanford.edu\/news\/message-arun-majumdar-looking-forward\">proposes asking four questions<\/a> to suss out potential bad actors. In this article, we will answer these questions for Stanford&#x2019;s fossil fuel partners in order to further our shared goal of a truly sustainable Doerr School.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/truesustainabilityschool.com\/\">Coalition for a True School of Sustainability<\/a>, the University&#x2019;s known fossil fuel partners include: BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy, EcoPetrol, Eni, Equinor, ExxonMobil, JX Nippon (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.eneos.co.jp\/english\/company\/history\/\">since 2020<\/a>: ENEOS), Occidental, Petrobras, PetroChina, Phillips 66, Repsol, Saudi Aramco, Shell, SK Energy and Total. For simplicity, we will refer to these companies as Stanford&#x2019;s &#x201C;Partners.&#x201D; Stanford <a href=\"https:\/\/truesustainabilityschool.com\/bigoilentanglements\">also engages with<\/a> the American Petroleum Institute, a national oil and gas trade association, as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/truesustainabilityschool.com\/paris\">several other fossil-related firms<\/a> not included here.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wherever possible, we will characterize Stanford&#x2019;s fossil-fuel Partners individually to <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.stanford.edu\/news\/message-arun-majumdar-looking-forward\">avoid painting the entire industry with the same brush<\/a>. This approach aligns with Stanford&#x2019;s Board of Trustees <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/2020\/06\/12\/trustees-commit-accelerating-transition-to-net-zero-greenhouse-gas-emissions\/\">2020 commitment to the Paris Agreement<\/a>: the Board eschews blanket fossil divestments, instead encouraging a case-by-case evaluation. With this in mind, we can address Dean Majumdar&#x2019;s four questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <em>Are [a Partner&#x2019;s] commitments aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/unfccc.int\/sites\/default\/files\/english_paris_agreement.pdf\">Paris Agreement<\/a> aims to limit the global average temperature increase to well below 2 &#xB0;C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to stay below 1.5 &#xB0;C. Stanford&#x2019;s fossil Partners do not appear to be committed to these goals: a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/10.1126\/science.abh0687\">2021 paper<\/a> in the journal <em>Science<\/em> analyzed Stanford&#x2019;s aforementioned Partners, concluding that only Occidental Petroleum comes close to meeting the Paris Goals. These findings are supported by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/ng-interactive\/2022\/may\/11\/fossil-fuel-carbon-bombs-climate-breakdown-oil-gas\">The Guardian<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/priceofoil.org\/2022\/05\/24\/big-oil-reality-check-2022\/\">Oil Change International<\/a>. Notably, Oil Change International found the climate pledges and plans of eight Stanford Partners to be &#x201C;grossly insufficient.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <em>Is [a Partner] devoting sufficient human and financial resources to meet its commitments?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To reiterate, most of Stanford&#x2019;s Partners&#x2019; commitments do not align with Paris goals. For these companies, any devoted human and financial resources are therefore insufficient by default. This point is underscored by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.climateaction100.org\/whos-involved\/companies\/?search_companies&amp;company_sector=oil-and-gas\">Climate Action 100+<\/a>, which judges none of Stanford&#x2019;s Partners Capital Alignment as &#x2018;aligned&#x2019;. <a href=\"https:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0263596\">A 2022 scientific study<\/a> reproduces these conclusions for BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell, stating that none of these companies are &#x201C;currently on the way to a clean energy transition.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. <em>Is [a Partner] supporting and promoting government policy that would create the business imperative for a transition to a clean economy?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To answer this question, it would be easy to cherry pick negative examples of fossil-fuel lobbying. This would seemingly disqualify ExxonMobil for <a href=\"https:\/\/influencemap.org\/report\/An-InfluenceMap-Note-ExxonMobil-Lobbies-the-EU-Commission-add01200dc694b00e9ac4bebf660227b\">lobbying<\/a> against the European Union&#x2019;s CO<sub>2<\/sub> vehicle standards, and Shell, BP, Equinor and Total for <a href=\"https:\/\/influencemap.org\/pressrelease\/EU-Green-Deal-at-Risk-from-Pro-Gas-Lobbying-17523\">promoting fossil gas<\/a> in Europe: these obstructive actions <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.stanford.edu\/news\/message-arun-majumdar-looking-forward\">conflict with Dean Majumdar&#x2019;s personal beliefs<\/a>. However, it might be more objective to judge companies for their overall lobbying behavior. To this end, <a href=\"https:\/\/ca100.influencemap.org\/index.html\">LobbyMap<\/a> lists the lobbying behavior of Stanford&#x2019;s fossil fuel Partners. It finds most of these Partners to obstruct climate policy and five Partners to express mixed positions. Notably, LobbyMap considers the American Petroleum Institute to be &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/lobbymap.org\/influencer\/American-Petroleum-Institute-API\/projectlink\/American-Petroleum-Institute-API-In-Climate-Change\">broadly hostile to climate policy in the US<\/a>.&#x201D; The Institute counts multiple Stanford Partners among its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.api.org\/membership\/members\">members<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.stanford.edu\/news\/message-arun-majumdar-looking-forward\">according to Dean Majumdar<\/a>, a company sometimes needs to &#x201C;produce oil and gas to avoid significant disruptions to human welfare, the economy and national security in the short term.&#x201D; In this case, one should ask:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>4. Does it still intend to meet its climate commitments in the long term?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, Dean Majumdar suggests that exceptional circumstances might justify temporarily increased fossil fuel production if producers still commit to long-term climate goals. Evaluating this question, we can assess how fossil fuel companies act during the Covid-19 pandemic or Russia&#x2019;s (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.iea.org\/reports\/russian-supplies-to-global-energy-markets\/oil-market-and-russian-supply-2\">#3 global oil producer<\/a>) invasion of Ukraine. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/influencemap.org\/\">Influence Map<\/a>, the American Petroleum Institute has used <a href=\"https:\/\/influencemap.org\/report\/The-Coronavirus-Crisis-and-Climate-Lobbying-23249d39450ff19b441090a6a50174eb\">both<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/influencemap.org\/pressrelease\/US-Oil-Gas-Sector-Used-Ukraine-to-Push-Expansion-19093\">crises<\/a> to lobby for rolling back existing or planned climate policy standards: these are not good signs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, it appears like Dean Majumdar&#x2019;s <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.stanford.edu\/news\/message-arun-majumdar-looking-forward\">questions<\/a> have no positive answers. This is not to say that no well-intentioned people work at or with Stanford&#x2019;s fossil fuel Partners: we personally know many such people. However, we must also recognize that the overall behavior of Stanford&#x2019;s Partners appears inconsistent with Dean Majumdar&#x2019;s criteria and the Board of Trustees&#x2019; commitments to the Paris Agreement.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Stanford engages with these Partners at an institutional level, it should therefore consider the risks. Should Stanford expose itself to what <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S221462962100476X?casa_token=4Jjiot_jMh8AAAAA:uQjdgsBx1DHDXcPW_MVJBlX210LfDvwuUHijypEWj2wmvZmDJAw-wUsUjG-nMFvukBdv-ONG_eM\">researchers describe<\/a> as greenwashing and ideological climate denialism? Does Stanford intend to help fossil-fuel companies <a href=\"https:\/\/truesustainabilityschool.com\/bigoilentanglements\">explore unconventional oil<\/a>, even though the IEA <a href=\"https:\/\/www.iea.org\/reports\/net-zero-by-2050\">deems further oil exploration incompatible<\/a> with net-zero goals? Both Stanford and the Doerr School should weigh these questions carefully.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, the research cited here suggests that Stanford&#x2019;s current fossil-fuel Partners do not even remotely match Dean Majumdar&#x2019;s criteria and the Board of Trustees&#x2019; Paris commitment. Although our concerns with fossil-fuel engagement <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/05\/12\/from-the-community-stanford-has-a-chance-at-a-real-school-of-sustainability-if-it-refuses-fossil-fuel-meddling\/\">extend beyond<\/a> merely meeting these requirements, discussing these concerns might be more appropriate once the Dean&#x2019;s and Board&#x2019;s minimum criteria are met. For now, accepting funding from fossil-fuel companies at the institutional level should be a non-starter if Dean Majumdar and the Board intend to follow their own guidelines.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Thom Hersbach argues that under Dean Majumdar&#8217;s four-part test, no fossil fuel company qualifies to fund Stanford&#8217;s School of Sustainability. &#8220;For now, accepting funding from fossil fuel companies at the institutional level should be a non-starter if Dean Majumdar and the Board intend to follow their own guidelines,&#8221; Hersback writes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":38,"featured_media":1203888,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[24],"tags":[57459,76777,1402,78167,78174,78166,78175,77800,78171,78168,208,78169,47391],"site-layouts":[],"coauthors":[16735],"parsely":{"version":"1.1.0","meta":{"@context":"https:\/\/schema.org","@type":"NewsArticle","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/02\/from-the-community-should-any-fossil-fuel-company-qualify-for-funding-stanfords-school-of-sustainability-a-response-to-dean-majumdars-letter\/"},"headline":"From the community | Should any fossil-fuel company qualify for funding Stanford\u2019s School of Sustainability?

world. This year, &#x201C;<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_Bk7hztQBMk\"><em>Generation Impact: The Scientist<\/em><\/a><em>&#x201D; follows Emily Tianshi &#x2019;25 and her journey in building a device that can help produce water in areas with drought. Tianshi lives in Wilbur and wants to pursue a major at the intersection of science and policy. The Daily interviewed Tianshi about her motivations and experience when building this device.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Stanford Daily [TSD]<\/strong>: Could you tell us a little bit about your motivations for trying to solve the water crisis?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Emily Tianshi [ET]<\/strong>: I think it started when I saw the effects of drought in California. Droughts would shape the state&#x2019;s water sensitivity, leading to lots of laws surrounding water usage. I&#x2019;m from Southern California, so&nbsp;we had to constantly think about water. There was a period of time when the beautiful lawns of grass near me all either died or turned into artificial grass. So I did some research into the matter: it turns out that California&#x2019;s situation is actually relatively better than many other places. For instance, we don&#x2019;t have to worry about finding water for ourselves everyday. But the water crisis is so much worse in other places in the world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TSD<\/strong>: What is your project about in &#x201C;Generation Impact: The Scientist?&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ET<\/strong>: My project was a device that would mimic the characteristics of the Torrey pine tree, which is found in San Diego. I studied the properties of the pine tree, most notably its moisture, which harvests micro patterns. The needles and surface properties of the Torrey pine tree are very unique from other pine trees. Most pine trees have needles that are hydrophobic, but Torrey pine needles are hydrophilic, which means that they absorb water. Thus, they absorb more water than your typical plant that goes through photosynthesis. But, upon closer inspection, there are stripes that are hydrophobic and hydrophilic, allowing the Torrey pine needles to contain and release water. The device in the video, which is modeled after the Torrey pine tree, allows for water harvesting.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TSD<\/strong>: You raise a really strong point regarding garage labs (a self made laboratory in a garage) in the documentary: garage laboratories allow for potential scientists to innovate even if they don&#x2019;t have the latest cutting edge technology. Could you elaborate on this? Is there some advice you could give to those who want to start their own garage lab?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ET<\/strong>: Garage labs are really powerful because they give the opportunity to address your personal questions. You can come up with a series of experiments to do using objects you already have. Science innovation is typically pictured with geniuses working in million dollar laboratories, but this picture isn&#x2019;t very accurate. We really need everybody who has an idea to try it out, especially with the climate crisis. I&#x2019;ve seen high schoolers &#x2014; even middle schoolers &#x2014; who have really great ideas, and they are totally accessible. I made a website with my brother called &#x201C;Clearwater Innovation,&#x201D; where plenty of kids can share their brilliant ideas. As for advice, you&#x2019;ll probably run into roadblocks along the way, so don&#x2019;t be afraid to ask for help! Professors are very open to helping anyone as long as they are passionate about what they are doing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TSD<\/strong>: Speaking of roadblocks, could you elaborate on any that you personally experienced?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ET<\/strong>: Nearly every step of the way was a roadblock. What was definitely helpful was reaching out to professors through email or at conferences. For instance, I needed a bigger fog chamber and a special camera for my work, so I presented my idea to a professor at the Torrey Pines Docent Society and asked him if he had a lab space and camera I was looking for. I ended up working at his lab at University of California, San Diego over the summer, and he was kind enough to allow me to borrow his equipment!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TSD<\/strong>: What would you like to accomplish during your time at Stanford?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ET<\/strong>: I think the great thing about Stanford is that you can invest in the power of intersectionality. There are activists in so many different fields. You can take classes with them, talk with them, grab lunch with them, and these conversations can improve your own advocacy. Doing so expands my view and allows me to consider stakeholders that I haven&#x2019;t thought of before. I get a lot of inspiration from my peers. In high school, it was just about science for me, but at the end of the day, science can&#x2019;t get you everywhere. You need different people to help you, and I think I&#x2019;m learning a lot in that regard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TSD<\/strong>: Do you have any closing remarks?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ET<\/strong>: I really hope that people don&#x2019;t come to view me as some sort of hero or genius. I really did this because I wanted to and because it was fun. The entire point I want to show in that film is that if I can do it, then anyone can.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editors Note: This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Emily Tianshi &#8217;25 was featured in film series &#8220;Generation Impact&#8221; for creating a device that can help produce water in areas with drought.

to find cheap summer housing if you\u2019re not doing a tech, consulting or finance internship"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>It&#x2019;s almost summer break, and you have secured your non-tech, non-consulting, non-finance, non-sell-out, low-paying-but-actually-improving-the-world-for-the-better internship. Congratulations!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#x2019;s one problem: you procrastinated on finding summer housing, and now, there seem to be no more suitable, cheap housing options in the New York\/San Francisco\/Los Angeles\/Seattle\/Boston area. Well, have no fear! Here are some helpful hacks to find the perfect place at the perfect price:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Sell some of your non-essential organs to increase your buying power: <\/strong>There are so many organs that the human body doesn&#x2019;t need. By keeping these organs, you&#x2019;re wasting valuable money that could go towards your summer housing! You can start off small &#x2014; the spleen is important to the immune system, but don&#x2019;t let that piece of information sway you from selling it. The liver can take over many of its functions just fine. If you&#x2019;re feeling more daring, you can auction off your least-favorite kidney.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Sneak into the trunk of someone&#x2019;s car: <\/strong>If you think about it, you&#x2019;ll be doing so many fun things in the summer that you&#x2019;ll only need your summer housing for sleeping, which is why all you have to do is sneak into someone&#x2019;s car trunk. It&#x2019;s easy. Just follow someone home, hijack their car, and you have yourself a shiny new crib for the summer!<\/li><li><strong>Live in a tech giant&#x2019;s guest house without them noticing: <\/strong>This one is simple. Pretend to be a gardener, and then sneak through a window to one of Elon Musk&#x2019;s guest houses. He won&#x2019;t even notice that one of the 28 rooms in his mansion has a stranger in it. If this doesn&#x2019;t work, try Mark Zuckerberg&#x2019;s five-house estate in Palo Alto.<\/li><li><strong>Don&#x2019;t sleep: <\/strong>Since you will mainly use your summer house for sleeping, a simple solution to not having summer housing is to not sleep! You&#x2019;ve practiced not sleeping so many times throughout your academic career that you&#x2019;re finally ready to test your skills with the ultimate challenge &#x2014; staying awake for 2,016 hours!<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you know these quick and dirty tips for affordable summer housing, you&#x2019;re ready to begin your internship and start changing the world!&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article is purely satirical and fictitious.

href=\"https:\/\/ccsre.stanford.edu\/education\/native-american-studies-program#:~:text=Student%20activism%20culminated%20in%20a,Studies%20in%20Race%20and%20Ethnicity.\"> Native American Studies (NAS) course<\/a> at Stanford in 1992 to academically advising the first student to ever major in NAS, Professor Robert Warrior was a pioneering Native American Scholar at Stanford.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During Warrior&#x2019;s seventh year teaching at Stanford, he applied for tenure through the English department. At the time, he had written two successful books &#x2014; both of which are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/kindle-dbs\/entity\/author\/B001JS8A90?_encoding=UTF8&amp;node=283155&amp;offset=0&amp;pageSize=12&amp;searchAlias=stripbooks&amp;sort=author-sidecar-rank&amp;page=1&amp;langFilter=default#formatSelectorHeader\">still in print today<\/a> &#x2014;and also played a major role in cultivating both NAS and the Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity program (CSRE).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, to many students and faculty&#x2019;s surprise, Warrior was denied tenure. In January of 1999, Warrior received notice that the Dean&#x2019;s office had rejected the English Department&#x2019;s recommendation that he be granted tenure.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;The line that was the most disappointing was there was a reference in the letter to me being a &#x2018;popular mentor.&#x2019; The implication was that if I had not spent so much time mentoring, to such a popular extent, that I could have gotten more work done,&#x201D; Warrior, who is now a <a href=\"https:\/\/english.ku.edu\/people\/robert-warrior\">Hall Distinguished Professor of American Literature &amp; Culture<\/a> at the University of Kansas, said. He ended up staying at Stanford until the summer of 2000.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not the only time that a professor with extensive responsibilities within an ethnic studies program was denied tenure. Just last year, Asian American Studies (AAS) lecturer William Gow <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2021\/08\/18\/lecturers-departure-renews-concern-over-lack-of-tenured-asian-american-studies-faculty\/\">left Stanford for a tenure-track position<\/a> at Cal State Sacramento.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;[Professor Warrior] is so well remembered in our community. It was really disturbing to me to hear that this happened and that it was not something that really inspired all that much change,&#x201D; Caelin Dae Marum &#x2019;21 M.S. &#x2019;22, who majored in NAS during her undergrad, said. &#x201C;[Our faculty] is really overworked. We don&#8217;t have the infrastructure to support people.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked by The Daily to comment on the tenure in the ethnic studies programs, Center for Comparative Studies for Race and Ethnicity faculty director Paula Moya drew a distinction between the interdisciplinary programs, like ethnic studies majors, and departments.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;What this means is that while CCSRE works with disciplinary departments to appoint into those departments faculty who work in the broad field of comparative studies of race and ethnicity, it does not appoint faculty into the IDP itself,&#x201D; Moya wrote. &#x201C;Faculty from different disciplinary departments, such as English, history, and sociology, cross-list courses in a way that allows students to learn from faculty across multiple academic areas. For the most part, tenure decisions occur in departments and tend to be focused on disciplinary concerns.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/ccsre.stanford.edu\/education\/undergraduate-program-comparative-studies-race-and-ethnicity\">CSRE program<\/a> houses five majors, which include NAS, AAS, CSRE, Chicana\/o-Latina\/o Studies (CHILATST), and Jewish Studies. However, CSRE, like all ethnic studies majors, is not a department but an interdisciplinary program (IDP).&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AAS program director Stephen Sano, a professor in the Music Department, explained that these programs aren&#x2019;t allowed to hire their own faculty. Instead, classes within these programs are often taught by affiliated faculty, who are actually housed under different departments.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Sano acknowledged that this structure leads to difficulties in retaining faculty and courses since the professors&#x2019; primary responsibility lies in a different department. He also explained that ethnic studies programs don&#x2019;t have a department chair or a strong, codified internal governance like other departments do.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;We&#8217;re limited in the kind of community we can build because people are stretched really thin across what they&#8217;re doing for their home units,&#x201D; Dr. Jonathan Rosa, the CHILATST Program Director, said.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, students are advocating for CSRE to follow the lead of African &amp; African American Studies, which is in&#xA0;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2021\/02\/22\/task-force-recommends-departmentalization-of-african-and-african-american-studies-program\/\" target=\"_blank\">the process<\/a>&#xA0;of departmentalization.&#xA0;<a href=\"https:\/\/linktr.ee\/desas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stanford D.E.S.A.S.<\/a>&#xA0;has created a&#xA0;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSdJgQ3Igo4R4JpgGkMgJf4nLtvue-MG-NHz9CJLDloq8UQ88g\/viewform\" target=\"_blank\">petition<\/a>&#xA0;and held&#xA0;a&#xA0;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLScI6y6tEIiu4c35v9mSHOSa4BVv5Z3i7iDRMuR5gBHTNuoNxA\/viewform\" target=\"_blank\">CSRE Faculty and Students Community Conversation<\/a>&#xA0;on May 27&#xA0;to garner support.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;We are aware that there is a student group advocating for departmentalization of CCSRE and are glad to know it,&#x201D; Moya wrote. The decision to departmentalize CCSRE would depend on the faculty involved with the program, the genuine and sustained enthusiasm of undergraduate and graduate students, and the administration of Stanford.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since CSRE programs cannot hire their own professors, it also impedes their ability to create a diverse faculty, both demographically and academically, Rosa said. According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/facultydevelopment.stanford.edu\/sites\/g\/files\/sbiybj9996\/f\/publications\/stanford_faculty_at_a_glance_2019-20_0.pdf\">2019-20 faculty demographics,<\/a> only 4% of professional faculty at the University identify as Latinx and 2% identify as Black or African American. There are five faculty members who identify as Native American, which is such a small number that they don&#x2019;t make up a percentage.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Program directors get funding to hire two lecturers each year for a one-quarter period to teach courses solely within their ethnic studies program. Although this does allow directors to bring in ethnic studies scholars from other universities, it creates a lack of consistency among faculty, since lecturers are being rotated out every quarter.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;It&#8217;s really important to maintain connections with professors, for example, with recommendation letters or just wanting to continue learning about a specific discipline,&#x201D; Phong Nguyen &#x2019;25, a prospective AAS major, said. &#x201C;The professors that I&#8217;ve had so far have been so engaging and so passionate and I truly learned a lot. I guess that my one wish is that they could stay here.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AAS is in the process of hiring an associate director for the program, according to Sano. This associate director will be expected to teach four classes a year within AAS, one of which is mandated to be Intro to Asian American Studies. They will also contribute to administrative aspects of the program and help develop curriculum.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sano hopes it will foster consistency and community within the program. The Department of Humanities and Sciences has also greenlit a similar position for both NAS and CHILATST, according to Sano.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s an exciting thing for the school to actually step up and say &#x2018;yeah, these programs actually need additional support&#x2019;,&#x201D; Sano said.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nguyen thinks this new position will be great and hopefully help fulfill Stanford&#x2019;s commitment to offering a proper and valuable education for all students.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Because Stanford is not investing in our education, we usually have to take leadership of our own education. An Associate Director will help Stanford do its job of providing students the necessary resources to engage in their studies,&#x201D; Nguyen said.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article is the first part of a two-part series about Ethnic Studies programs at Stanford.

alumni file lawsuit against Stanford"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>The alumni of Theta Delta Chi Fraternity (TDX) are filing a lawsuit against the University according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/savestanfordtdx.com\/stanford-alumni-group-files-lawsuit-against-university\/\">release<\/a> posted on Save Stanford TDX&#8217;s website Wednesday. The complaint alleges Stanford violated TDX&#8217;s due process rights by punishing the fraternity arbitrarily for the death of a student and fraternity member.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>University spokesperson Karla Hudson wrote, &#8220;We have seen the petition, we disagree with it, and we intend to vigorously contest the claims in it,&#8221; in response to an inquiry from The Daily.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>TDX was <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2021\/03\/22\/tdx-disbanded-after-investigation-finds-illicit-substances-in-house\/\">suspended<\/a> after Eitan Weiner &#x2019;22 was found dead in the house in <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/01\/17\/student-found-dead-in-theta-delta-chi-house\/\">January 2020<\/a> after accidentally ingesting fentanyl in counterfeit Percocet pills. Weiner&#x2019;s family <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/01\/21\/eitan-weiners-family-sues-stanford-tdx-after-sons-overdose-death\/\">filed<\/a> a wrongful death suit in December 2021 against TDX, Stanford, three students and a fourth unaffiliated individual. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The family&#x2019;s complaint alleges Stanford repeatedly failed to follow the University&#x2019;s Residential Education policies in the days leading up to Eitan&#x2019;s death on Jan. 17, 2020. The family is also arguing that Stanford and TDX neglected their duty to warn the student body of the risk of lethal counterfeit Percocets being circulated in Santa Clara County at the time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>TDX&#8217;s lawsuit alleges the University violated the fraternity&#8217;s rights by &#x201C;arbitrarily punishing&#x201D; them and invoking a six-year suspension of the fraternity and removal of the fraternity from their home on campus. According to the alumni group, the six-year suspension was an attempt to shift blame to the fraternity on Weiner&#x2019;s passing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;In its 130-year history, Stanford University has never enacted such a draconian measure against one of its student-led organizations,&#x201D; attorney Mark M. Hathaway said in the release. &#x201C;They have fundamentally violated the rights of Theta Delta Chi members and alumni, and in doing so, have not only suspended the fraternity from campus without cause, but they have also arbitrarily and unjustly tarnished the reputation of the organization and its individual members.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lawsuit alleges the University did not find evidence of wrongdoing by members of TDX, and that Weiner&#x2019;s death was unrelated to the actions of TDX members.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stanford also committed multiple due process violations because TDX was not granted access to evidence the University used or the witnesses interviewed, the lawsuit alleges. Finally, according to alumni, the original university committee at the hearing recommended probation for the fraternity but the Office of Student Affairs&#x2019; six year suspension was &#x201C;completely unprecedented&#x201D;

help No One Left Behind, a non-profit with comprehensive evacuation and resettlement of Iraqi and Afghan allies left behind after the U.S. <a

three main things,&#x201D; said No One Left Behind Director of Advocacy and Marine veteran Jeff Phaneuf M.B.A. &#x2019;23. &#x201C;We do evacuation &#x2014; that&#8217;s everything from chartering flights to helping facilitate people get on U.S. government flights. We do resettlement, which is helping folks who make it to the US with things like car loans and grants for furniture, clothing and rental assistance. But my job is to advocate for changes in the law and changes and governmental action.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nooneleft.org\">Founded<\/a> in 2014 by once-Afghan interpreter Janis Shinwari with money used to resettle his family, No One Left Behind has grown into the largest organization focused on aiding former U.S. interpreters and foreign government employees in adversary nations, according to Phaneuf. In 2021 alone, No One Left Behind evacuated 493 Afghans and successfully advocated for Congressional legislation that significantly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/117th-congress\/house-bill\/3237\/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22emergency+security+supplemental+appropriations+act%22%2C%22emergency%22%2C%22security%22%2C%22supplemental%22%2C%22appropriations%22%2C%22act%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1&amp;s=3\">reduced<\/a> the wait time Afghan families faced for Special Immigrant Visas (SIV) from the typical 3.5 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To describe the danger Afghan U.S. allies face in their nation, Hoover Institution veteran fellow and No One Left Behind executive director Philip Caruso recalled a specific Afghan collaborator &#x2014; Bakht Mohammad &#x2014; that he interacted with during his time at a base in the city of Kandahar. When the Taliban captured and killed Mohammad, it jarred Caruso into advocacy for those like his late acquaintance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Bach Mohammed was viewed as a collaborator and was targeted and ultimately killed for his willingness to talk to me and his employment at the base,&#x201D; Caruso said. &#x201C;And so I saw firsthand the consequences that these kinds of people faced for being willing to support us.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caruso shared that No One Left Behind currently tracks 62,000 Afghan allies of the U.S. who are seeking to emigrate, and that the organization shares the information with the U.S. government so that both entities can coordinate frequent evacuations. This comes with a special importance since during the withdrawal from Afghanistan, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul <a href=\"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/world\/live-news\/afghanistan-taliban-us-news-08-18-21\/h_d30bd55a3b210977ca2564bb9762e7e9?fbclid=IwAR0iYRrxj1FDNv4QGvFfwa0Zd3i5dfMMn83IuvbGnbsE3Q1nGHln28LNvbA\">destroyed<\/a> some passports in its possession, according to Phaneuf.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phaneuf added that almost all of those passports came from Afghans who temporarily turned those documents over to finalize their visas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m working with an Afghan right now who &#x2014; ready to get his visa finalized and scheduled for a flight in late August &#x2014; handed in his passport, but, because of that, is now trapped in Afghanistan,&#x201D; Phaneuf said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hoover Institution policy makers work closely with No One Left Behind, foremost among them&nbsp; &#x2014; retired Lieutenant General Herbert Raymond McMaster. The 26th U.S. National Security Advisor and a commissioned officer for thirty-four years, McMaster <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hoover.org\/profiles\/h-r-mcmaster\">oversaw<\/a> the preparation and execution of many operations in the Middle East &#x2014; particularly Iraq and Afghanistan. This experience drives his &#x201C;work with No One Left Behind and other groups under the Hoover Afghanistan Relief Team,&#x201D; he wrote to The Daily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also in a statement to the Daily, McMaster&#x2019;s chief of staff Chelsea Berkey wrote that they and the Hoover Afghanistan Relief Team &#x201C;remain grateful for No One Left Behind&#x2019;s sustained efforts to support Afghans at every level of their evacuation and resettlement journey.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Caruso, priorities of No One Left Behind moving forward include increasing the capacity of sites and facilities to host American allies in hostile nations as they await evacuation, continuing advocacy for the shortening of visa-receival timelines and to ensure that these American allies receive robust aid in settling into American society as well as treatment for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) induced by their service in war.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;A lot of these folks &#x2014; since they served in combat &#x2014; suffer from mental health issues like PTSD, and they don&#8217;t receive either health care benefits or educational benefits the way that veterans do,&#x201D; Caruso said. &#x201C;Over the long run, we&#8217;re advocating for benefits to be provided to this population so that they&#8217;re able to fully integrate and assimilate into American society and ultimately become the most productive contributors in our society that they can.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the legislative proposal that Caruso said possesses the most bipartisan support is &#x201C;to simplify&#x201D; SIV programs focused on evacuating American allies in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria and similar countries, and to coalesce those SIV programs &#x201C;into one permanent program,&#x201D; so that Congress would not have to &#x201C;year after year authorize and appropriate more visas.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phaneuf explained that this legislation would also close current gaps in SIV programs, such as a twelve-month requirement of active service and disqualification for someone who &#x201C;served for 10 months and then was wounded while on a combat tour with U.S. troops.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Similarly, if the principal applicant passes away before they reach a certain stage in the application process, then their family loses their right to a special immigrant visa,&#x201D; Phaneuf added.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He hopes that the legislation will repeal this type of disqualification scenario.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another piece of legislation in development that Phaneuf discussed with members of the Congress and the U.S. State Department in early May focuses on ensuring that these American allies would not be deported a few short years after being granted refuge in the states.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, Phaneuf stressed that if the United States leaves behind allies in nations such as Afghanistan with vengeful governments like the Taliban, the U.S. will lose credibility in the sight of future potential partners in war.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;We hope and pray that the U.S. avoids conflict as much as it can, but the reality is that there will be conflicts in the future,&#x201D; Phaneuf said. &#x201C;And when that happens, we need the people who worked for us to be confident that we&#8217;re going to uphold our promise of protection. I think that&#8217;s a national security issue.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article has been updated to reflect the correct spelling of Bakht Mohammad&#8217;s name and clarify his relation to Jeff

Stanford esports players speak on how they avoid burnout"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p><em>Though they may seem cushy, esports bear challenges that are not seen as much in traditional sports. A recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/video-games\/esports\/2022\/04\/19\/esports-age-retirement\/\">Washington Post article<\/a> dives into the concept of esports burnout that many players experience early on in their careers. Most players retire in their early to mid-twenties, which is much earlier compared to traditional athletes. The popular explanation for this phenomenon is that the older players get, the more their reflexes decline.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The players themselves state various reasons for early retirement, such as insufficient prize money and low salaries for the number of rigorous hours put into practicing. Training on an esports team is extremely exhausting: some teams congregate in one large gaming house to practice for 12 to 14 hours per day, six times a week. It is difficult for players to maintain a good work-life balance when they are surrounded by their co-workers and managers every day. Hours of gaming can also result in neck pain, wrist pain and shoulder pain.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand burnout in esports, The Stanford Daily reached out to the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanfordvga.weebly.com\/\">Stanford Video Game Association<\/a> and interviewed two students, Max Jardetzky &#x2019;24 and Charlie Gordon &#x2019;24.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Stanford Daily [TSD]:<\/strong>What pushed you to play video games competitively rather than casually?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Max Jardetzky [MJ]: <\/strong>I didn&#8217;t originally plan on playing Rocket League competitively, and it wasn&#8217;t until I was admitted to Stanford in late 2019 that it would actually come to fruition. By that point, I&#8217;d already been playing the game for over three years, and had built up around 2000 hours of playtime. I was just hooked on the game, and that carried me all the way to the highest rank at the time (Grand Champion) with a standing of around top ~0.1% in the world. I was definitely open to playing at the college level, but it wasn&#8217;t until I met my roommate and best friend a few months after admission that I imagined it would happen.&nbsp;In a word, the reason I started playing competitively is because I met five other Stanford students who were as good at and dedicated to the game as I was. We all have thousands of hours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Charlie Gordon [CG]: <\/strong>I think a combination of being a generally quite competitive person, combined with wanting to play a more strategic and organized game, is what led me to playing competitively. I think a lot of people don&#8217;t necessarily get that there can be such a big difference between playing a game casually versus playing in a team environment. Mainly, one of the key differences is focusing a lot more on tactics and building a proper synergy with teammates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TSD:<\/strong> What does it look like to be super competitive and part of an esports team? How many hours do you usually spend gaming?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>MJ:<\/strong> I think this may be one of the bigger misconceptions (that we&#8217;re super competitive), at least for our team. It has always been casual and fun-first. We did have a rigorous practice schedule last year, but they were mostly friendly scrimmages and round robins against each other. The understanding is that we&#8217;re all there for fun and for social enrichment, but we do enjoy winning when we can. I would say at our peak, we were probably doing 6 hours a week of practice, maybe on top of an hour or two every other day or so of fun ranked sessions. These days, I almost play sparingly, and my teammates are on much more often. I&#8217;d say the most I&#8217;ve done this school year so far is a few hours a week, maximum.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The definite all-time highlight of being on the Stanford Rocket League team, however, was the road trip most of us made down to Los Angeles over spring break to sit front-row at the first professional international LAN (Local Area Network) tournament since the pandemic. Teams from all over the world came to compete for 5,000 live attendees and over 100,000 viewers on Twitch. It was here that I realized that the scene means a lot to people and that maybe I would have taken it more seriously if I were just a bit more gifted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CG:<\/strong> Being part of an esports team can look quite different to playing a game casually or even compared to playing competitively but not in a team environment. Time doing so can be spent in a variety of ways, whether that be through having practice matches against other teams or doing VOD (Video on Demand) reviews of previous gameplay. Obviously involvement can be quite varied, but for some teams it can look quite like being in a club or team project, with logistics and scheduling having to be worked out, as well as needing to acquire coaches and a manager. I probably spend anywhere from 6-10 hours a week doing team related things. This amount is in part due to being on teams outside of Stanford, though for Stanford it&#8217;s usually about 2-3 hours a week, with weeks in which we have tournaments or league games, sometimes being more involved.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TSD:<\/strong> Many professional players retire around their early twenties and turn to Youtube or Twitch afterward, but it has become a growing trend to start on these platforms instead of playing professionally due to the healthier work-life balance and autonomy one has over their schedule. Do you have any thoughts about this? Perhaps there is indeed less of an incentive to join a professional esports team?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>MJ:<\/strong> I can relate to this growing trend. Esports at a high level is all about consistency, and this is especially true in the case of Rocket League. In fact, a lot of goals scored in our games are due to incredibly minor mistakes in mechanics, positioning and communication. It can be very mentally taxing to make a mistake on a touch you feel like you&#8217;d have 95% of the time that immediately results in a goal for the opposing team. My biggest struggles with competitive Rocket League have definitely had to do with mentality and mindset. I&#8217;m definitely a perfectionist as well as an emotional player, which can be a rough combination.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like being part of an esports team is only worth it as long as you&#8217;re enjoying yourself because only from that enjoyment can consistent performance follow. There have definitely been moments of conflict within our team, mostly about coordinating our playstyles and correcting others&#8217; mistakes. Sometimes the hardest thing to do is find fault in yourself, but it&#8217;s a necessary part of the process of improvement on a competitive level. Playing this game for so long, yet still being leagues behind the actual top players has definitely humbled me, but regardless, it&#8217;s been incredible to be a part of one of the most unique clubs at Stanford.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The difficulty of maintaining stature within the competitive scene over this last year due to the sheer time commitment required has been rough for all of us, since we are all focused on our studies first. I have recently put down the game to nurture other aspects of my life, and it has been one of the better decisions I&#8217;ve made recently. I have definitely seen my mental health improve since I set the game aside for the most part this spring quarter.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CG:<\/strong> Burnout in esports is definitely real, though there are certainly other factors which can be attributed to early retirement. Not unlike more physical sports, there are undeniably prime ages for which someone can play, at least for the highest levels. This is in part due to a reaction\/processing difference in younger people, though it is also in part due to the intensity of esports and their constant changing, which means you are required to relearn a lot of other skills, which can be harder as you get older.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&#8217;s Note: This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&#8217;s Note: A previous version of this article misspelled Max Jardetzky&#8217;s surname.

I was never taught what it means for something to end. I want to know &#x2014; how can I bring more intention to departing a relationship? What does it mean to say goodbye?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#x2019;m five years old when my grandfather is diagnosed with dementia. Nine when he&#x2019;s forced into memory care. 10 when he forgets our names. My family never talks about this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Is grandpa okay?&#x201D; I ask after each visit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; my father replies curtly. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll wait in the car, okay?&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#x2019;m 13 when we hold his funeral; my uncle is last to go up to the podium and see his open casket. Almost immediately, he collapses to the floor, and eight years of tears break loose all at once. The rest of the church falls silent as he clasps onto my grandmother&#x2019;s thigh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry, I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201D; he cries. And he says something to the departed body, something else I was never taught how to say: &#x201C;I love you.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last September, I say goodbye to my family for the first time. I travel 5,700 miles west. As orientation starts, as I introduce myself to stranger after stranger at events with hundreds of people, I can&#x2019;t help but start feeling homesick. One night, after everyone has left for an event, I&#x2019;m the only one left in our dorm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An RA notices me sitting alone in the lounge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She sits down next to me. &#x201C;Hey, everything okay?&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#x2019;m about to say I&#x2019;m fine, before I notice she&#x2019;s looking me in the eyes &#x2014; the first time anyone has done so that week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I reply, &#x201C;I think I made a mistake coming to Stanford. I&#x2019;m so awkward at those events.&#x201D; I tell her how I think I&#x2019;ve forgotten how to socialize with other teenagers, that I&#x2019;m better off withdrawing before school starts and taking another gap year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Hm&#x2026;&#x201D; A few seconds later, she says, &#x201C;I guess you have two choices here. Option A, you go to the event and try to find just one person to talk to, and maybe you make a new friend? Option B, you can hang out with us. We have chips!&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She continues, &#x201C;I think you should do whatever feels the most comfortable. But either way, we&#x2019;ll be here for you to come home to.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I choose option A, and hate the event. I get back to my dorm lounge and am met with, &#x201C;You came!&#x201D; For the rest of the night, I eat chips with my new friend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One Friday night, I&#x2019;m talking to some friends in the dorm, and the topic of aging comes up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One friend shows us a TED Talk clip; the speaker talks about a hospice patient with breathing problems. &#x201C;Well, guess what? She wants to start smoking again. French cigarettes, if you please. Not out of some self-destructive bent, but to feel her lungs filled while she has them.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another says, &#x201C;I never want life to just stop. I want to learn everything, experience everything.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We spend the rest of the night playing cards, giving each other nicknames, warm mugs in our hands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later at 2 a.m., I take a walk around campus alone. I never expected the feeling to come like this &#x2014; music blaring in the background, bodies tumbling around me &#x2014; but I finally feel at home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other memories I&#x2019;ve kept:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#x2019;m singing along to a Korean ballad song when he, someone who grew up in a village 4,500 kilometers away from me, walks into the bathroom. We stare at each other for a few seconds in deadlock. Then, he starts singing with me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day after my breakup, one of my friends notices me eating lunch alone. &#x201C;Do you want peanut butter?&#x201D; She dashes to the dining hall and back, balancing two plates on each hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few days after the breakup, another friend knocks unexpectedly on my door. Looking down at the floor, he says, &#x201C;Hey, I just came to say&#x2026;&#x201D; After swaying side to side for a few seconds, his back straightens, and he looks me in the eyes. &#x201C;I came to say that I feel bad. I&#x2019;ve been so busy doing work instead of thinking about you &#x2026; I&#x2019;m sorry. Are you doing okay?&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later, my voice quivers as I tell another friend about how it bothers me that I fought so much with my mother last winter break, and how I sent her the most awkward voice message on her birthday. I&#x2019;m scared she&#x2019;ll judge me; instead, she says, &#x201C;Wait &#x2014; I&#x2019;m so proud of you!&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During spring break, I receive a text message from the South Korean military.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x200C;Date of Enlistment: August 22, 2022.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Date of Discharge: May 22, 2024.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One week later, my friends submit their housing applications for next year without me. Some of them I won&#x2019;t see until they&#x2019;re seniors; some will have left by the time I come back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry &#x2014; we&#x2019;ll call every weekend,&#x201D; one of them says. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ll draw housing together when you&#x2019;re back.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>But what if we drift apart?<\/em> I think to myself. <em>I&#x2019;m going one direction, you&#x2019;re going the other &#x2014; what if our friendship dies?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My best friend from high school texts me for the first time in a year: &#x201C;Hey. I know that summer after senior year was a messy time for both of us, but our friendship still means a lot to me. I&#x2019;m coming to SF next week. Can we talk things out?&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later during our meal, while he&#x2019;s using the bathroom, I tap on his phone on the table. His wallpaper is the same one from high school: a photo of us sitting crisscrossed on our school&#x2019;s football field, our arms around each other&#x2019;s shoulders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During a day trip to the beach in Half Moon Bay, I see one of my friends standing alone near the shore. Her body looks like a speck against the backdrop of the ocean, and there&#x2019;s a panorama of mountains far in the distance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I walk over and place a hand on her shoulder. &#x201C;Hey, everything okay?&#x201D; Her eyes look misty, as if she&#x2019;s been crying for the past few minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;This thing we call &#x2018;the present.&#x2019; It&#x2019;s so small. So fragile.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She pinches her fingers together. &#x201C;Come, look.&#x201D; I peer into the tiny gap between her fingers, and I see the rest of our friends in the distance, huddled on a picnic blanket and pouring lemonade for one another, oblivious to how small they look.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s my happiness right there, my ball of joy. And I love you all so much.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have an image: a few weeks from now, my friends and I are approaching the entrance to my gate. Tears start falling from our eyes; each one feels like a slipping away of parts of ourselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t go,&#x201D; they say uselessly. A pain stabs my heart as I look ahead to the security checkpoint.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, we also huddle together one last time. I hug each of them &#x2014; longer, tighter, more fully than I have done so in the past, when we still had so much time. As my friends look into my eyes and smile, I realize, I don&#x2019;t feel scared anymore. Seldom have I had the chance to cry so purely. I finally say, &#x201C;I love you.&#x201D;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hanmin Lee writes: Growing up, I was taught how to meet new people, but I was never taught how to say goodbye to them.

spending quality time with loved ones.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While most freshmen have plans to work or conduct research this summer, Reaves opted instead to be a lazy good-for-nothing and lounge around the house, pursuing his personal interests and helping his aging parents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t believe he&#x2019;d rather spend summer with his family than coworkers twenty years older than him,&#x201D; said Reaves&#x2019;s freshman roommate Kyle Larson, who hasn&#x2019;t seen his family in eleven months and counting. &#x201C;Staying home and passing time with your loved ones doesn&#x2019;t help your career one bit. He&#x2019;s losing out on valuable networking opportunities.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sources close to the unproductive student confirmed that Reaves will do little more than engage in pointless hobbies that bring him joy and watch his baby sister grow up in front of his eyes this summer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;He has no interest whatsoever in doing an internship that sounds prestigious to other people but will actually assign him menial tasks and crush his soul,&#x201D; said classmate Miles Thorsted, who will be working eighty hours a week at a consulting firm this summer. &#x201C;I would hate to be him.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Classmates told The Daily that Reaves is &#x201C;unambitious&#x201D; during the school year as well, citing his refusal to stay up late studying for midterms because he puts his health and well-being before his grades. &#x201C;While everyone else is constantly grinding for their futures, Josh finds satisfaction and fulfillment in the present,&#x201D; said classmate Carmen Reyes. &#x201C;Unbelievable.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s going to regret spending three months forming deeper bonds with his family and friends,&#x201D; said dormmate Maia Agarwal of the deadbeat student. &#x201C;He could&#x2019;ve spent all that precious time at the bottom ranks of a large corporation, making Excel spreadsheets.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;When we get back, people will ask him about what he did this summer, and he&#x2019;ll have to tell them he cherished time with his family and pursued activities meaningful to him,&#x201D; she added. &#x201C;How embarrassing.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article is purely satirical and fictitious.

the community | White Coats and Green meals"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p><em>Akshay Swaminathan and Wasan Kumar<\/em> <em>are first year MD candidates<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, on a sunny August afternoon, we lined up with our fellow incoming medical students on the Dean&#x2019;s lawn to receive our white coat and stethoscope. The White Coat Ceremony marks the start of our training as future physicians. Held annually before the beginning of the first quarter, the ceremony is a time for students to celebrate the start of their medical career with friends and family and enjoy a nice meal courtesy of Stanford catering. At our ceremony, however, several of our classmates were unable to celebrate this occasion over dinner with our loved ones. As we approached the food station after the ceremony, we found that there were no dinner options left for vegetarians.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, insufficient vegetarian options are not a rare occurrence at Stanford events. Throughout our first year here, we have attended lunch seminars, dinner seminars, orientations, club meetings and other events where the food options for vegetarians were limited or nonexistent. Not only does a lack of vegetarian options mean that our cultural or moral commitments are not recognized, but it also means that we are unable to choose a food option that reduces our impact on the environment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having spent my [Akshay&#8217;s] entire life on the East Coast, I had never heard of the abbreviation AQI (air quality index) until coming to Stanford. During my first few weeks on campus, I found myself googling &#x201C;Palo Alto AQI&#x201D; nearly every morning as I saw the smog from forest fires floating over campus. The haze was not very different from the smog I had seen in Beijing during a trip a few years ago. In fact, the AQI in Palo Alto sometimes exceeds that of Beijing, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/jamesconca\/2018\/08\/23\/the-ten-most-polluted-cities-on-earth\/?sh=4ffc89ef18cc\">one of the most polluted cities in the world<\/a>. Stanford is already doing a lot to address climate change, from its <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability-year-in-review.stanford.edu\/2015\/snapshots\/marguerite-fleet-increases-electric-buses\/\">electric shuttle buses<\/a>, to <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability-year-in-review.stanford.edu\/2021\/\">departmental carbon emissions goals<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability-year-in-review.stanford.edu\/2016\/snapshots\/seven-rde-student-housing-residences-convert-to-green-cleaning\/\">eco-friendly cleaning solutions<\/a>. Why can&#x2019;t we adopt a similar environmentally conscious approach when it comes to food?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The evidence is clear that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/d41586-019-02409-7\">plant-based diets are generally more environmentally friendly than non-vegetarian diets<\/a>. In fact, the UN IPCC report indicates we could reduce greenhouse emissions by six gigatons a year (or 16.5% of total emissions) if everyone reduced their meat intake to once a month, and eight gigatons (or 22% of total emissions) if everyone completely stopped eating meat. Plant-based meals are typically cheaper than meat-based meals and would save money for Stanford and its dining services if implemented at scale. Plant-based meals are also more inclusive because non-vegetarians can typically eat vegetarian, but not the other way around. Non-vegetarians may even prefer to eat vegetarian depending on the options available. In fact, at our White Coat Ceremony, the shortage of vegetarian meals happened because non-vegetarians snatched up the limited number of vegetarian meals before the vegetarians could (we don&#x2019;t blame them &#x2014; those enchiladas looked good!). Similarly, as the cost and taste of plant-based meat substitutes approaches those of regular meat we hope to ameliorate meat-lovers&#x2019; concerns of compromising on the flavors and textures they know and love.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are ways to encourage plant-based dining habits without alienating those who prefer meat-based options. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8014907\/\">One effective approach<\/a> is &#x201C;default vegetarianism,&#8221; in which vegetarian meals are the default option and non-vegetarian meals must be explicitly requested. This method opposes the status quo, where vegetarians must specially request a plant-based meal because the default option is typically meat-based. In a default vegetarian world, everyone can eat whatever they want, but folks are nudged toward choosing the more environmentally friendly option. Opt-out strategies, like default vegetarianism, have been <a href=\"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jpubhealth\/article\/43\/2\/392\/5637580\">successful in diverse settings<\/a>, including raising organ donation rates, encouraging healthy decision making and even increasing philanthropic donations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach is not unheard of at Stanford. Pockets of the Law School, School of Earth Sciences and Business School are vegetarian by default, if not completely vegetarian. There are also the <a href=\"https:\/\/defaultveg.org\/\">DefaultVeg<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/gfi.org\/the-alt-protein-project\/\">AltProtein<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/rde.stanford.edu\/dining\/one-plate-one-planet\">One Plate, One Planet<\/a> movements, which aim to encourage sustainable plant-based eating habits across Stanford. As we expand access to plant-based meals, the quality of Stanford catering&#x2019;s vegetarian meals will only improve.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food sustainability is a complex and nuanced issue. A rigorous approach to sustainable food practices may consider whether or not food is locally sourced, what type of farm produces the food, how far the food travels from where it was produced to Stanford, etc. We must be thoughtful about how we encourage climate-conscious food, but there are steps in the right direction that we can take immediately. While <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/heres-how-much-food-contributes-to-climate-change\/\">not all plant-based foods have a low climate footprint<\/a>, it is clear that on average, plant-based diets are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pcrm.org\/good-nutrition\/vegan-diet-environment#:~:text=A%20plant%2Dbased%20diet%20can,beans%E2%80%94help%20protect%20the%20planet.\">more environmentally friendly<\/a> than animal-based diets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stanford can continue to strive for a campus environment that is sustainable, inclusive and tasty for all students by learning from those in our community who are already taking a thoughtful approach to sustainable food practices. As medical school acceptances were released earlier this month, we hope that the incoming class of students can look forward to a delicious plant-based meal to share with their friends and family at the next White Coat Ceremony.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Akshay Swaminathan and Wasan Kumar argue that Stanford should better support plant-based dining habits. &#8220;The evidence is clear that plant-based diets are generally more environmentally friendly than non-vegetarian diets. In fact, the UN IPCC report indicates we could reduce greenhouse emissions by 6 gigatons a year (or 16.5% of total emissions) if everyone reduced their meat intake to once a month, and 8 gigatons (or 22% of total emissions) if everyone completely stopped eating meat,&#8221;

Graduating with a Masters in Music Science and Technology, she is using her scientific and technical knowledge to produce more positive and environmentally attentive music.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1365\" height=\"1379\" src=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image3.jpg?w=800\" alt=\"Madame Gandhi dressed in a yellow pantsuit and shade sits on the steps of the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics\" class=\"wp-image-1204899\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image3.jpg 1365w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image3.jpg?resize=594,600 594w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image3.jpg?resize=768,776 768w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image3.jpg?resize=1188,1200 1188w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image3.jpg?resize=600,606 600w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image3.jpg?resize=100,100 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px\" \/><figcaption><em>Madame Gandhi sits on the steps of CCRMA in a bright yellow suit.

(AYA AZIZ\/The Stanford Daily)<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Before coming to Stanford, Gandhi toured as a drummer for M.I.A., Kehlani and Lizzo, all while also earning an MBA from Harvard.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After coming to speak at CCRMA in 2016, Gandhi fell in love with the program&#x2019;s state-of-the-art facilities and jumped at the opportunity to do a Masters at Stanford. Gandhi emphasizes that, with cutting edge technology and a leading role in electronic music production, &#x201C;CCRMA is the beginning of what then permeates the rest of the industry.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to her love for music, Gandhi is passionate about activism. She made <a href=\"https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/voices\/comment\/here-s-why-i-ran-the-london-marathon-on-the-first-day-of-my-period-and-chose-not-to-wear-a-tampon-10455176.html\">headlines<\/a> when she ran the London marathon while free-bleeding (menstruating without menstrual products) to advocate for the de-stigmatization of menstruation. She combines music with advocacy to deliver catchy and visually impactful messages. Her music video, &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-bNdmBeQHI4\">Waiting for Me<\/a>,&#x201D; which encouraged women to use their voices against systemic oppression, won the Music Video Jury Award at the SXSW Film Festival in 2021.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gandhi is coming into her own as a musician after gaining experience drumming for other artists. She pushes for an approach to music production that more directly engages with the environment. In March, Gandhi took a trip to <a href=\"https:\/\/madamegandhi.blog\/2022\/04\/28\/madame-gandhi-3-min-antartica-polar-plunge-for-climate-solidarity-goes-viral-on-instagram\/\">Antarctica<\/a> to record sounds of animals underwater to use as samples for snare drums and synthesizers. She hopes to produce music using sounds that are organically sourced from the natural environment. &#x201C;We have a conscious movement when it comes to food &#x2014; whether we&#8217;re buying vegan or non-GMO or organic. Where&#8217;s that conversation when it comes to music, in the lyrics, in the source of the actual instruments?&#x201D; she asks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gandhi&#x2019;s Masters program advisor Chris Chafe wrote that Gandhi has &#x201C;amplified the appreciation of bioacoustics at [CCRMA].&#x201D; He explained Gandhi&#x2019;s penchant for listening and finding the beauty of music in nature: &#x201C;I had the good fortune to accompany Gandhi for a visit with hundreds of elephant seals at A&#xF1;o Nuevo State Park this winter. She is someone who gets quiet and tunes in deeply and, except for that, I think the rangers and I wouldn&#8217;t have heard the symphonic chorus that was before us.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1411\" src=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image2.jpg?w=800\" alt=\"Madame Gandhi spins a drumstick in her hand as she plays on a drumkit\" class=\"wp-image-1204902\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image2.jpg 1999w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image2.jpg?resize=600,424 600w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image2.jpg?resize=768,542 768w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image2.jpg?resize=1200,847 1200w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image2.jpg?resize=800,565 800w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image2.jpg?resize=1536,1084 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px\" \/><figcaption><em>Madame Gandhi plays the drums with a flourish in one of CCRMA&#x2019;s cutting edge recording studios. She loves drums&#x2019; strong rhythm and ability to unite people. (AYA AZIZ\/The Stanford Daily)<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever since discovering her love of drums at a summer camp when she was 12 years old, Gandhi has placed the dynamic instrument at the heart of her music. Her approach to drums differs from most studios: Gandhi laments that much of the drum beats in music now are produced through &#x201C;copying and pasting&#x201D; previously sampled beats &#x2014; sometimes, studios don&#x2019;t even have live drum sets. For her, however, live drums are indispensable because they inject life into her music. &#x201C;I think drums are a source of human expression. Drums are a heartbeat; drums have flavor and soul and an emotion,&#x201D; she explains.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gandhi is enthusiastic about live drums&#x2019; ability to unite people through joyful rhythm. &#x201C;Our live shows are more alive because they&#8217;re so rhythm oriented. Everyone&#8217;s dancing the whole time,&#x201D; she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For &#x201C;Music, Computing, Design: The Art of Design&#x201D; (MUSIC 256A), Gandhi created an immersive musical experience in a boxing gym by designing a video game which illuminated pieces of &#x201C;playable&#x201D; equipment. At each station, the sounds of punching, jump ropes or speed bags turned into percussive beats with the ability to be recorded and layered. In this boxing gym, players could hear the physical imprint that their bodies left on the world, transforming music into a corporeal experience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;The whole concept of drumming or boxing, it&#8217;s just about freedom. It&#8217;s about expression. It&#8217;s about any person, of any gender, doing anything they want to,&#x201D; Gandhi said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image4.jpg?w=800\" alt=\"Madame Gandhi poses sitting at the recording studio\" class=\"wp-image-1204903\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image4.jpg 1999w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image4.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image4.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image4.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image4.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image4.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px\" \/><figcaption><em>Madame Gandhi mixes audios and beats using music software Ableton Live in CCRMA&#x2019;s recording studio.

(AYA AZIZ\/The Stanford Daily)<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Being conscious of the impact her music has on the world and the ethics involved in its dissemination is especially important to Gandhi. She recognizes that she relies on streaming platforms for her music to reach a large audience, which implicates her in the complicated ethics surrounding big data. She takes classes at Stanford that educate her on the ways in which companies use data to exploit and marginalize disadvantaged groups.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given Stanford&#x2019;s privileged position in the tech industry, Gandhi pushes students to take charge by increasing awareness about the various ways that tech companies use data. &#x201C;Unless the smart people who are the ones driving the whole thing forward are also the people keeping it in check, there&#8217;s no balance,&#x201D; she warns.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In her coursework at Stanford, she is studying the neurological effects of music to write songs that generate positive emotions in her listeners. &#x201C;I&#8217;m most interested in healing; I&#8217;m most interested in happiness; I&#8217;m most interested in positivity and people feeling uplifted through my musical choices as an artist. And so when I can understand scientifically which frequencies might enable that, which BPM (beats per minute), which speed of a song, which tones might inspire someone to feel good, that knowledge motivates me to then put those kinds of choices into my body of work,&#x201D; she explains.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assistant Professor of Music Patricia Alessandrini applauded Gandhi for her contributions to the CCRMA community. &#x201C;Her compelling and engaging approach to music technology in performance and composition, including the creation and sharing of tools and resources for other artists, is an inspiration to the CCRMA community and the field as a whole,&#x201D; Alessandrini wrote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image1-1.jpg?w=800\" alt=\"Madame Gandhi plays on a synthesizer \" class=\"wp-image-1204904\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image1-1.jpg 1999w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image1-1.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image1-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image1-1.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image1-1.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image1-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px\" \/><figcaption><em>Madame Gandhi riffs on the keyboard.

A visually attentive person, Gandhi uses the album&#x2019;s aesthetics to reinforce her message: &#x201C;In the past album artworks, the outfits that I wear are very buttoned up. This one we ended up just going completely skin to express that vulnerability and that openness and finding power in the openness.

Since then, members of the AAPI community have built a deep history at this institution, from the establishment of Okada in 1971 to the founding of several AAPI student organizations as early as the 1980s and 1990s. AAPI Heritage Month is celebrated across the country in May to recognize the accomplishments and history of Asians and Pacific Islanders in the U.S. At Stanford, the month is commemorated annually through various events, such as the annual <a href=\"https:\/\/a3c.stanford.edu\/programs\/saaa\">Asian American Awards Ceremony<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/stanford.edu\/nightmarket\">Stanford Night Market<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To better understand what AAPI Heritage Month means to the Stanford community, The Daily interviewed undergraduate students who identify as AAPI. Students shared their thoughts on a variety of topics, from what it means to be AAPI at Stanford to their experiences being a part of specific ethnic communities across campus. Several acknowledged that certain groups within the AAPI community were historically underrepresented and said that while there are elements that bridge together the experiences of AAPI students, the experience of individual students can vary dramatically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Note: This article is intended to capture a part of the AAPI community &#x2014; not to serve as a holistic representation.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"5000\" height=\"4000\" src=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_7262.jpg?w=800\" alt=\"Image of Lauren Seu '23 smiling in Old Union.\" class=\"wp-image-1205125\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_7262.jpg 5000w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_7262.jpg?resize=600,480 600w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_7262.jpg?resize=768,614 768w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_7262.jpg?resize=1200,960 1200w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_7262.jpg?resize=750,600 750w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_7262.jpg?resize=1536,1229 1536w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_7262.jpg?resize=2048,1638 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5000px) 100vw, 5000px\" \/><figcaption><em>Lauren Seu &#x2019;23 &#x2013; Chinese American, Japanese American, Native Hawaiian.

I feel when people are saying like &#x2018;AAPI this or AAPI that,&#x2019; they&#8217;re talking about Asian American issues, which is fine, but also there are so many different communities. There are lots of different Asian American communities, different issues, but Pacific Islander issues are a very different scope. It&#8217;s not like the model minority myth. In Hawaii even, Native Hawaiians are overrepresented in the homeless population and not going to higher level education, there aren&#x2019;t as many opportunities. What the term AAPI means to me: it is who I am. I&#8217;m proud of that, but at the same time, it doesn&#8217;t feel entirely encompassing of what it should be.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"4564\" height=\"3651\" src=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_7261.jpg?w=800\" alt=\"Image of Matthew Nguyen '24 smiling outside the Stanford Daily building. \" class=\"wp-image-1205126\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_7261.jpg 4564w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_7261.jpg?resize=600,480 600w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_7261.jpg?resize=768,614 768w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_7261.jpg?resize=1200,960 1200w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_7261.jpg?resize=750,600 750w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_7261.jpg?resize=1536,1229 1536w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_7261.jpg?resize=2048,1638 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4564px) 100vw, 4564px\" \/><figcaption><em>Matthew Nguyen &#x2019;24 &#x2013; Vietnamese American.

But I came to learn a little bit more about the history of the term Asian American, and it was a political term, coined to bring together marginalized communities to advocate for rights through collective power. And I think that helped me kind of understand what it meant for me to be Asian American.

Under <a href=\"https:\/\/leginfo.legislature.ca.gov\/faces\/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB481\">Assembly Bill 481,<\/a> law enforcement agencies are required to receive approval from their local governing body for the acquisition and continued use of military equipment. Among the military items and uses that the Sheriff&#x2019;s Office wants approved are: continued use of 280 Colt AR-15 and other assault and sniper rifles, a new $465,000 robot (on top of the three robots already in inventory) and unrestricted use of &#x201C;less lethal&#x201D; (i.e. rubber bullets) and chemical munitions, according to the meeting <a href=\"http:\/\/sccgov.iqm2.com\/Citizens\/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?Frame=&amp;MeetingID=14423&amp;MediaPosition=&amp;ID=111219&amp;CssClass=\">agenda<\/a>. This list does not include the inventory within the Stanford University Department of Public Safety&#x2019;s (SUDPS) possession.<strong> <\/strong>According to the agenda, <strong>SUDPS alone has 32 Colt AR-15 rifles and eight Defense Technology 40mm Launchers for &#x201C;less lethal&#x201D; munitions, among other items.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) pointed out during the meeting, these types of militarized equipment do not keep communities safe: they exacerbate the threat posed to Black and Brown communities due to already existing disparities in policing, and they do not keep communities safe. Studies show that they fail to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41562-020-00995-5\">reduce crime<\/a> and\/or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/doi\/10.1073\/pnas.1805161115\">attacks on police<\/a>, but that they <em>do <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/2053168017712885\">increase<\/a> the <a href=\"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/1065912918784209\">amount of violence<\/a> communities face at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aclu.org\/report\/war-comes-home-excessive-militarization-american-police\">hands of police.<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AFSC also pointed out that the Sheriff&#x2019;s Office proposed Military Equipment Use Policy violates state and county law. <a href=\"https:\/\/leginfo.legislature.ca.gov\/faces\/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB48\">Assembly Bill 48<\/a> prohibits the use of kinetic energy projectiles (i.e. &#x201C;less lethal&#x201D; munitions) and chemical agents to disperse any assembly, protest or demonstration except under very specific circumstances (such as threat to life or of severe bodily injury). And perhaps most importantly, the Military Equipment Use Policy places few to no restrictions on its use of militarized equipment. There are no explicit prohibitions on use of any of these items, nor are there real limitations (most uses are defined as &#x201C;including, but not limited to&#x201D;).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these deficiencies and community concerns, the Sheriff&#x2019;s Office argued that this military equipment is needed to respond to incidents like the 2021 VTA shooting in San Jose. Indeed, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thenation.com\/article\/society\/derecka-purnell-becoming-abolitionists\/\">police often invoke<\/a> mass shootings as a justification for their militarization, as well as their very existence. Unfortunately, in the past few weeks, we&#x2019;ve seen multiple times just how empty the promise of safety through militarized police forces truly is. In Uvalde, TX, a gunman killed 19 children and two adults at a local elementary school. It&#x2019;s difficult to imagine a more disastrous police response: the gunman was inside the school for around <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/2022\/05\/27\/texas-school-shooting-uvalde-gunman-timeline\">80 minutes,<\/a> roughly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2022\/05\/27\/us\/uvalde-shooting-police-response-timeline\/index.html\">50 of which<\/a> involved 19 police officers waiting inside a school hallway, refusing to confront the lone gunman. Federal marshals and Uvalde Police Department officers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-us-canada-61604652\">reserved their violence<\/a> for family members urging action: one woman was briefly handcuffed, a father was thrown to the ground by an officer, another was pepper-sprayed and another was tasered. Meanwhile, students trapped inside made at least <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/05\/27\/us\/texas-shooting-911-call-press-conference.html?smid=url-share\">seven 911 calls<\/a> begging police &#x2014; who they could hear right outside &#x2014; for help. Ultimately, it took a separate law enforcement agency <strong>receiving a key from a school janitor <\/strong>before the gunman was killed and children were able to leave.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The knee-jerk response to tragedies like this is to call for more police funding. But that would make a mockery of the people who lost loved ones in recent weeks in the face of police incompetence. Uvalde spends <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nydailynews.com\/news\/politics\/us-elections-government\/ny-aoc-texas-school-shooting-money-law-enforcement-20220526-h5qllrucmjanrj4kxrikedw3q4-story.html\">40% of its budget<\/a> on police and has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/us-news\/uvalde-texas-school-shooting-security-plan-rcna30568\">more than doubled<\/a> the amount it spends on school policing since 2017, from roughly $200,000 to $435,000. In Buffalo, NY, a 911 dispatcher <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/nation\/2022\/05\/19\/buffalo-shooting-911-dispatcher-suspended\/\">hung up the phone<\/a> on an employee trapped in the grocery store attacked by a white supremacist gunman. New York City <a href=\"https:\/\/gothamist.com\/news\/nyc-will-add-250-more-nypd-officers-patrol-subway-system\">increased<\/a> the amount of law enforcement dedicated to the subway system by 250 officers last May, only for the <a href=\"https:\/\/nyunews.com\/opinion\/2022\/04\/18\/nypd-incompetent-subway-shooting-cut-funding\/\">NYPD to fail<\/a> to prevent the attack or apprehend the gunman.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have <a href=\"https:\/\/itsgoingdown.org\/militarized-law-enforcement-dont-protect-us-from-mass-shooters\/\">decades&#x2019; worth<\/a> of similar examples of police failure in the context of mass shootings. We also know that in the two years since George Floyd was murdered, police have gone to kill over <a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/6180605\/minneapolis-police-reform-george-floyd-murder\/\">2,000 more people<\/a>, or about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2022\/mar\/30\/us-police-killing-people-high-rates\">three people per day.<\/a> Whether we want to admit it or not, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/news\/daily-comment\/seeing-america-again-in-the-texas-elementary-school-shooting\">we are living in a death cult<\/a>, in no small part due to this country&#x2019;s obsession with police. As writer, lawyer and activist Derecka Purnell writes in &#8220;Becoming Abolitionists,&#8221; &#x201C;[S]tructural violence, like militarism and policing, can create and shape interpersonal violence, like assaults, murders and mass shootings . . . . Plainly put, when the federal government uses law enforcement and the military to control concentrated wealth, property and natural resources, they condition everyday people to accept the violence, replicate it or rebel against it.&#x201D; We must be among those who rebel against it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We must work to end policing, war and militarization here and around the globe. And there&#x2019;s plenty we can do locally to be part of this struggle:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Santa Clara County is <a href=\"https:\/\/services.sccgov.org\/OffAgenda\/Home\/ViewFile\/467\">currently undergoing a review<\/a> of SUDPS, part of a once-in-a-20-year opportunity to update the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanfordcommunityplanupdate.org\/background\">Stanford Community Plan<\/a>.

If you or someone you know are in need of help, you can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three months ago, Stanford student Katie Meyer &#x2019;22 <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/03\/02\/stanford-student-and-soccer-goalkeeper-katie-meyer-22-dies-at-22\/\">died<\/a> in a campus residence. Now, Meyer&#x2019;s parents, Gina and Steve, are pushing for a nationwide change to university policies that they believe can help save the lives of college students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.katiessave.org\/f19ht-katies-save\">policy<\/a>, named &#x201C;Katie&#x2019;s Save&#x201D; after the women&#x2019;s soccer goalkeeper, aims to establish institutional mechanisms that would allow for closer contact between universities and parents about challenges facing their children. The drafted policy offers students the choice to opt into a system that would automatically notify a designated advocate when the student faces circumstances including disciplinary action, physical injury, substance abuse and academic probation. The policy has since garnered more than 3,500 signatures in support from community members at Stanford and across the country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to University spokesperson Karla Hudson, Stanford administrators &#8220;have recently learned of Katie&#x2019;s Save from the media and will be studying the proposed policy.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Clearly, with the storm of suicides, the systems in place have failed,&#x201D; Steve and Gina told The Daily. &#x201C;Our daughter, Katie, is gone. Gone far too soon. She died at a school she dreamed of going to and worked so hard to prepare for; and gave her entire self to, in attempts to succeed and represent the school with strength, fierce spirit and loyalty, innovation and intelligence.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;So we are now fighting to find purpose through our pain,&#x201D; they added. &#x201C;And we believe the time for some real change is right now.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Meyer family hopes that such a policy would help mitigate what they see as a critical disconnect between parents and children attending college. After Meyer&#x2019;s death by suicide, Gina and Steve explained that there were &#8220;no red flags&#8221; about their daughter&#x2019;s mental health in the days preceding.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in the days following Katie&#x2019;s death, Gina and Steve shared that she had been in the process of <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/03\/04\/potential-disciplinary-action-from-stanford-may-have-contributed-to-katie-meyers-22-death-her-parents-say\/\">dealing<\/a> with potential disciplinary action for &#x201C;defending a teammate on campus over an incident.&#x201D; According to the family, Katie had been <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/03\/02\/stanford-student-and-soccer-goalkeeper-katie-meyer-22-dies-at-22\/\">involved<\/a> with the proceedings for more than six months prior without their knowledge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;While we have been attempting to piece things together on our own, we continue to have many unanswered questions that remain of concern,&#x201D; Gina and Steve said. &#x201C;As a result of the lack of information provided, and other factors, we are not in a position to provide further details at this time.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the details of Katie&#x2019;s circumstances, the Meyers are concerned that campus pressures can be exacerbated by the stresses of college athletics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Tuesday, they spoke about the proposed measure <a href=\"https:\/\/www.today.com\/parents\/parents\/college-students-suicide-families-rcna30737\">on the Today Show<\/a> along with a panel of parents of student athletes who died by suicide. While prompted by cases involving student athletes, the Meyers think that Katie&#x2019;s Save has the potential to help any student overcoming adversity in college.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though the policy recommendation has received an outpouring of support from community members and experts, the path toward implementing such a policy at Stanford is murky. Recent <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2019\/10\/07\/stanford-to-overhaul-leave-of-absence-policies-in-watershed-class-action-settlement\/\">changes<\/a> to mental health-related protocol have come as the result of legal action, not public pressure and advocacy alone. In 2019, Stanford was forced by a class-action lawsuit to change a policy that required students to take a leave of absence if the University determines there is a &#x201C;significant risk to the student&#x2019;s health or safety or the health or safety of others, or the student&#x2019;s behavior severely disrupts the University environment.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, Stanford&#x2019;s community standards policies do not include a mechanism to automatically notify designated individuals about disciplinary issues. <a href=\"https:\/\/communitystandards.stanford.edu\/student-accountability-process\/when-you-are-notified\">According to<\/a> the Office of Community Standards, the University has &#x201C;accommodations available to protect the privacy of individuals who have brought forward a concern, to the greatest extent possible.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Meyer family believes the proposed policy would give students and parents the flexibility to make a plan that is tailored to their personal situations. In the process of crafting the policy, the Meyers worked with medical professionals at the NCAA&#x2019;s Sports Science Institute and the Pac-12 Research Development Center, as well as other organizations &#x201C;with interest in student mental health.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian Hainline, the NCAA chief medical officer, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/college-sports\/story\/_\/id\/34013887\/parents-stanford-goalie-katie-meyer-died-suicide-push-katie-save-policy-additional-safety-net\">told<\/a> ESPN that Katie&#x2019;s Save can serve as a &#x201C;safety valve&#x201D; for students in vulnerable situations as they navigate their unique circumstances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Meyer family is also considering spearheading a forum that would address &#x201C;broader action items and other changes needed to evolve in the university systems that govern our students&#8217; lives to ensure their safety and well-being in the future.&#x201D;&nbsp;They said that while they recognize there may be hurdles to clear in the implementation of Katie&#x2019;s Save and accompanying efforts, it constitutes &#x201C;a battle well worth fighting.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the family, Stanford has not offered any comment to them or their legal team on the proposed policy. But Gina and Steve said they hope Stanford and schools across the nation will support the initiative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Our goal is to continue to gain support to have Katie&#x2019;s Save implemented nationwide &#x2014; and we will take the necessary steps to obtain that support and ultimately, implementation in schools across the country.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Support is available for students through Stanford&#x2019;s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) 24\/7 at (650) 723-3785.

medicine. So when he came to Stanford, he looked for a major that would allow him to explore this field and fulfill the necessary pre-med requirements. He landed on Human Biology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>57 student athletes &#x2014; 45 from women&#8217;s teams and 12 from men&#8217;s teams &#x2014;&nbsp;are recorded as majoring in <a href=\"https:\/\/humanbiology.stanford.edu\/\">Human Biology<\/a> (HumBio), making it the most common path of study among declared Stanford athletes, according to data that The Daily scraped from each team&#x2019;s 2021-2022 roster on <a href=\"https:\/\/gostanford.com\/\">GoStanford<\/a>. Duplicates were removed from the dataset; for example, athletes competing in both cross country and track and field were not double-counted. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-flourish wp-block-embed-flourish\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"https:\/\/flo.uri.sh\/visualisation\/9950350\/embed#?secret=XUW60BeEEh\" data-secret=\"XUW60BeEEh\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" height=\"575\" width=\"700\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><figcaption><em>Human Biology (HumBio) is the most popular major among Stanford athletes. 57 current athletes have declared HumBio as their major.<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Management Science and Engineering (MS&amp;E) is the second most popular major among athletes with 39 total students. It is followed by Computer Science and Science, Technology &amp; Society (STS), which are tied for third with 37 athletes each. Economics rounds out the top five with 36 declared athletes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an interdisciplinary program, the Human Biology major gives students a solid foundation in biology while also allowing them to choose their own area of concentration. According to the program&#x2019;s director, Lianne Kurina Ph.D. &#x2019;98, about half of Stanford&#8217;s HumBio majors are looking to pursue medicine, but many others are interested in community health, social justice issues related to health, social determinants of health and human performance, among other related topics.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Women&#x2019;s volleyball junior opposite hitter Kendall Kipp is one athlete on the human performance track. She said she chose HumBio for reasons similar to Phillips. Kipp has always been interested in science and human performance, and felt she could shape the HumBio major into what she wanted to study.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;There&#8217;s so much flexibility with choosing your courses because you can truly create your own track to fit what you want to get out of it,&#x201D; Kipp said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why Human Biology?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for why so many athletes choose to major in HumBio, Kurina has some ideas. Three factors she believes make the major attractive for athletes are its &#x201C;flexibility and course options,&#x201D; athletes&#x2019; general interest in &#x201C;understanding the human body and applications to their sport&#x201D; and &#x201C;word of mouth from teammates.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The major&#8217;s popularity makes sense to Phillips, who sees it as an extension of the awareness athletes develop over years of training to get to the elite collegiate level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I think a lot of athletes growing up tend to have a close connection and they&#8217;re really in tune with their bodies,&#x201D; Phillips said. &#x201C;They love talking to people about their stories, how they have developed into who they are.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Phillips plans to go to medical school after graduating, Kipp is considering pursuing a career related to athletic training. Like Phillips, she credits the major&#x2019;s popularity among athletes to its many options. Students select either a B.S. or B.A. degree, pick an area of concentration and then choose courses with guidance from their advisors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;At the end of the day, every student designs their own course of study, what they&#8217;re going to be experts in,&#x201D; said Kurina.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-wp-embed is-provider-flourish wp-block-embed-flourish\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"https:\/\/flo.uri.sh\/visualisation\/9950172\/embed#?secret=E0ZXSOadFM\" data-secret=\"E0ZXSOadFM\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" height=\"575\" width=\"700\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><figcaption><em>Human biology is also the most common major among athletes on Stanford&#8217;s women&#8217;s teams, with 49 female athletes declaring the major.<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Navigating HumBio as an athlete<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Phillips, athletic commitments have occasionally complicated the process of scheduling courses. While in season, the men&#x2019;s gymnastics team often had 1:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. practices, preventing him from being able to take most classes in the afternoons. During competition weeks, Wednesdays were occupied by inner squads &#x2014; tryouts to determine which athletes would compete that weekend.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when Phillips went to the Human Biology department with his predicament, he said they worked with him to build a schedule that did not conflict with his practices or inner squads. And, according to Phillips, this flexibility extends to the rest of the department&#8217;s teaching staff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;They are always willing to work with me,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I remember traveling, they were always willing to make sure that I stayed on top of the material and gave me resources so that when I came back, I was able to get help from TAs [Teaching Assistants].&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kipp also praised the department, saying, &#x201C;I&#8217;ve never run into an issue with a HumBio professor before about missing classes&#8230; there have been issues with other departments sometimes, but HumBio has always been super supportive.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an instructor, Kurina has only positive things to say about the &#x201C;incredibly proactive&#x201D; student athletes she has taught. She believes that the department&#x2019;s professors familiarity with athletes contributes significantly to athletes&#x2019; positive experiences within the major.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;&#x200B;&#x200B;Because of the long history of athletes in our classes, HumBio faculty know what wonderful students they are, and the kinds of constraints they&#8217;re typically under,&#x201D; Kurina said.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-wp-embed is-provider-flourish wp-block-embed-flourish\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"https:\/\/flo.uri.sh\/visualisation\/9929339\/embed#?secret=uxH4DTm7vh\" data-secret=\"uxH4DTm7vh\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" height=\"575\" width=\"700\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><figcaption><em>Human biology is only the fifth-most popular major amongst athletes on the men&#8217;s teams; MS&amp;E and Computer Science are the most common amongst male athletes, with 26 majoring in each subject.<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&#x201C;This population doesn&#8217;t register any differently&#x201D;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the department may be familiar with athletes and the obligations they are balancing in addition to their schoolwork, Kurina emphasized that she and her colleagues see the athletes in their classes as regular students and they are treated as such.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;This population doesn&#8217;t register any differently,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I think it&#8217;s really important that instructors are consistent in their requirements across students in general. That&#8217;s important for students, to know that they&#8217;re being treated fairly and equitably.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kurina also made clear that while HumBio professors have experience supporting student athletes, their first priority is delivering the best content and course curriculums possible to all students &#x2014; both athletes and non-athletes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phillips and Kipp are grateful for the support they have received from teaching staff, but they expressed that being a Stanford student athlete comes with additional challenges<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phillips said that there have not always been other athletes in his classes, which led him to form study groups with whoever he could.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I think that&#8217;s been good for me too, because I&#8217;ve been able to separate myself from the team sometimes and make more relationships and connections with other people who are into human biology,&#x201D; he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And despite vigorous practice and competition schedules, both Kipp and Phillips feel that the Human Biology department has allowed them to make the most of their time at Stanford academically and athletically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking to the support she has received, Kipp said that she feels the coaching staff and professors &#x201C;want you to get the most out of your academic experience here.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I don&#8217;t feel like I lost any potential of learning material,&#x201D; Phillips said of his busy athletic career and experience in the HumBio major. &#x201C;I gained more from the experience I&#8217;ve had and classes I&#8217;ve taken.&#x201D;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>57 student athletes are recorded as majoring in Human Biology,

The case count marks a spring quarter record of 475 total cases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Student case counts increased by 49% from the prior week, while employee case counts declined by 3%. As of Tuesday, 305 students are isolating, which is an increase from the 218 students reported <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/05\/24\/stanford-covid-19-cases-jump-to-spring-quarter-high-of-399\/\">last week<\/a>, according to the dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elevated case counts coincide with the University&#x2019;s Friday announcement that undergraduates with housing contracts ending in mid-June are <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/05\/29\/move-out-is-approaching-here-is-what-you-should-do-if-you-test-positive-for-covid-19\/\">still expected<\/a> to move out on time even if they test positive for COVID-19 between Tuesday and move-out day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Daily reached out to the University for comment regarding whether finals will be impacted by the rise in cases and whether the move-out policy will change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stanford&#x2019;s seven-day positivity rate rose from 8.01% the prior week to 12.20% this week &#x2014; a rate higher than both <a href=\"https:\/\/covid19.ca.gov\/state-dashboard\/#location-santa_clara\">Santa Clara County&#x2019;s<\/a> 9.1% rate and <a href=\"https:\/\/covid19.ca.gov\/state-dashboard\/#location-santa_clara\">California&#x2019;s<\/a> 7.0% rate. The seven-day positivity rate among employees decreased from 2.42% last week to 2.26% this week. The reported positivity rates include results from Color tests only, according to the dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The University continues to <a href=\"https:\/\/healthalerts.stanford.edu\/covid-19\/2022\/02\/17\/testing-and-other-covid-19-updates\/\">provide<\/a> free COVID-19 testing for the campus community, and students who are not fully vaccinated and boosted for COVID-19 are <a href=\"https:\/\/studentaffairs.stanford.edu\/resources-our-communities\/covid-19-guidance-students\/accountability\">required<\/a> to test twice weekly. While the weekly testing requirements for vaccinated employees and students were <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/02\/17\/stanford-to-lift-covid-19-surveillance-testing-requirements-for-spring-quarter\/\">lifted<\/a> in March and April, respectively, the University strongly recommends testing in the event of symptoms, possible exposure or travel, according to the dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Masks continue to be <a href=\"https:\/\/healthalerts.stanford.edu\/covid-19\/2022\/05\/16\/reminder-of-covid-presence-and-value-of-masking%EF%BF%BC\/\">strongly recommended<\/a> on campus and required on Marguerite buses, in healthcare facilities and in classrooms except while speaking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A total of 4,168 students and 2,384 faculty, staff and postdocs have tested positive through Stanford&#x2019;s surveillance testing program since June 29, 2020, according to the dashboard.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Student case counts increased by nearly 50% from the prior week,

Lee \u201923 to appear in new Wes Anderson feature \u2018Asteroid City\u2019"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Last summer, as most Stanford students were preparing to move back to campus for the first time in over a year, one student, Ethan Lee &#x2019;23, was preparing to fly to Spain &#x2014; he had been cast in &#x201C;Asteroid City<em>,<\/em>&#x201D; the latest film by director Wes Anderson, and was about to spend the next few months shooting the movie.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lee began acting in kindergarten, when he started joining school theater productions to help with a speech impediment, but it was not until he was nine years old that he began going to auditions and pursuing on-camera acting professionally, mainly working on TV and some film. Initially, Lee was unsure if he wanted to pursue acting professionally due to the large time commitment it requires and his academic priorities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;My parents were initially hesitant. When I was younger, the rule was always school first, acting second,&#x201D; Lee said. &#x201C;It was such a big time commitment as well &#x2014; you&#x2019;re getting out of school, driving to LA, auditioning, getting back at around 7 or 8 p.m. &#x2014; and then you&#x2019;ve got homework and extracurriculars. But there&#x2019;s some cathartic experience [in acting] that you can&#x2019;t replicate anywhere else, so I kept on going back.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lee&#x2019;s first professional acting role was on the show &#x201C;Southland.&#x201D; It was also his first-ever audition. Lee has since appeared in many TV shows including &#x201C;Glee,&#x201D; &#x201C;Desperate Housewives,&#x201D; &#x201C;The Middle,&#x201D; &#x201C;KC Undercover&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Mick.&#x201D; He also played a recurring character on &#x201C;Mr. Robinson,&#x201D; a short-lived NBC sitcom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of Lee&#x2019;s roles has taught a unique lesson to the actor. &#x201C;I enjoyed working on a series and seeing different character arcs,&#x201D; Lee said of &#x201C;Mr. Robinson.&#x201D; &#x201C;It taught me how to pace myself when filming, because filming is exciting and a lot of fun, but it&#x2019;s easy to spend all of your energy really quickly or get carried away with craft services. You can&#x2019;t do that if you&#x2019;re trying to do a long-term thing. You have to pace yourself.&#x201D; From his brief appearance on &#x201C;Glee,&#x201D; Lee says, &#x201C;I learned the value of being spontaneous &#x2014; my part in Glee was improvised and that&#x2019;s something I&#x2019;d never experienced before.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Asteroid City&#x201D;<em> <\/em>is the biggest project he has booked to date. Aside from its title, very little is currently known about &#x201C;Asteroid City&#x201D; &#x2014; all elements of the plot are being kept completely under wraps. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Asteroid_City\">Wikipedia<\/a>, the film is an &#x201C;American romantic comedy-drama&#x201D;, and a <a href=\"https:\/\/deadline.com\/2021\/11\/wes-anderson-asteroid-city-adds-ethan-josh-lee-1234872284\/\">Deadline article<\/a> lists a plethora of A-list actors who have been linked to the project, including Tom Hanks, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Sophia Lillis, Adrien Brody, Maya Hawke, Fisher Stevens and many more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the confidential nature of the project, Lee is not able to reveal too much, avoiding any specific descriptors of what he was asked to do on set.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I had a great time working with Wes and the cast and crew,&#x201D; Lee said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Asteroid City&#x201D;<em> <\/em>was filmed in Chinch&#xF3;n, a town in Spain around forty minutes south of Madrid. An article in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/10\/22\/movies\/the-french-dispatch-wes-anderson.html\">The New York Times<\/a> claims that Anderson&#x2019;s &#x201C;cast and crew often take up a local hotel, and dine together, too.&#x201D; Anderson himself has stated that he likes to &#x201C;go to a place and have us all live there and become a real local sort of production, like a little theater company.&#x201D; In &#x201C;Asteroid City,&#x201D; the close living quarters helped create a closer community on set, according to Lee.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;It was a very communal atmosphere,&#x201D; Lee said. &#x201C;As are many Wes projects, from what I&#x2019;ve heard.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Production on &#x201C;Asteroid City&#x201D;<em> <\/em>wrapped in October. Lee arrived on campus a few weeks late for fall quarter, but was able to coordinate with his professors to make up for any in-person classes he&#x2019;d missed. A few of his classes were online, so he was able to participate remotely. Nevertheless, he said that balancing academics and acting for a few weeks proved to be a little more difficult than he expected. He is currently pursuing a major in political science and a minor in history.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While at school, Lee&#x2019;s first priority is his academics, though he still continues to audition for film projects. William Golub &#x2019;23, a friend of Lee&#x2019;s from his freshman dorm, spoke to Lee&#x2019;s ability to pursue various interests at once.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve had discussions on things like the economics of film production and the consolidation of producers, as well as the intersection of media and international relations,&#x201D; Golub said. &#x201C;Ethan&#x2019;s the kind of guy who brings people together in an awesome way, so it makes sense that he is part of so many communities in and outside of Stanford.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;In acting, he&#x2019;s phenomenally talented,&#x201D; said Donya Sarrafian &#x2019;23, one of Lee&#x2019;s housemates from last spring. &#x201C;I got to watch some of his highlight reels and was very impressed by them. I talked to him after &#x201C;Asteroid City,&#x201D; and he was incredibly excited to be doing that work. I&#x2019;m incredibly excited to see the movie in 2023.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working on &#8220;Asteroid City&#8221; has made Lee confident that he wants to continue to pursue acting after college. &#x201C;I have other interests outside of performing arts and film and media, but there&#x2019;s nothing that compares to the artistic catharsis and fulfillment,&#x201D; Lee said. &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t get that with any other career.&#x201D;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ethan Lee &#8217;23 speaks to Georgia Limcaoco about his experience filming with Wes Anderson

We have compiled a playlist of our staff&#x2019;s latest jams. <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/playlist\/2u1kzKhlu76gn0w9TC0jbX?si=3752704d93a2442e\"><em>Listen<\/em><\/a><em> to our picks playlist, and check out our article to learn more about the recommendations.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Spotify Embed: May &amp;apos;22 Music Staff Picks\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" src=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/embed\/playlist\/2u1kzKhlu76gn0w9TC0jbX?si=3752704d93a2442e&#038;nd=1&#038;utm_source=oembed\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alec Benjamin &#x2014; Dopamine Addict (Recommended by Vanessa Chen &#x2019;25)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I discovered this song after listening to Alec Benjamin&#x2019;s newest album, Un(Commentary). The rhyming of the phrases &#x201C;dopamine addict&#x201D; and &#x201C;psychosomatic&#x201D; caught my attention the first time I listened to this tune, and I have been listening to it ever since. Alec Benjamin also has a great voice, so make sure to check out his other songs!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wet Leg &#x2014; Ur mum (Recommended by Richard Coca &#x2019;22)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This diss track written by Wet Leg will have you yelling out &#x201C;I feel sorry for your mum&#x201D; in the middle of Green Library with its engrossing storytelling and catchy chorus. The repetition in the pre-chorus feels playful and juxtaposes nicely with the song&#x2019;s story about a failed relationship. Culminating with screaming, this song oozes catharsis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mitski &#x2014; That&#x2019;s Our Lamp (Recommended by Kyla Figueroa &#x2019;24)<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s Our Lamp&#x201D; was released in 2022 on Mitski&#8217;s newest album &#x201C;Laurel Hell.&#x201D; While lyrically sad, reflecting on a time when the speaker and their partner used to love each other, the instrumental is upbeat and optimistic. The contrast in tones shows the emotional layers of ending a relationship &#x2014; there&#x2019;s sadness in the present but hope for the future.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sarah Kinsley &#x2014; What Was Mine (Recommended by Kyla Figueroa &#x2019;24)&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new month, a new Sarah Kinsley single. &#x201C;What Was Mine&#x201D; was released with the announcement of Kinsley&#x2019;s forthcoming Cypress EP &#x2014; available on all streaming platforms on June 10. The song follows the artist&#x2019;s journey through heartbreak, with the lyrical epiphany being that what she&#x2019;s mourning the loss of was never hers to begin with. The second verse is my favorite part, featuring a musical build that gives me chills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rina Sawayama &#x2014; This Hell (Recommended by Kyla Figueroa &#x2019;24)&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After getting hooked to her first album &#x201C;SAWAYAMA&#x201D; and attending her concert in SF, I was ecstatic when Rina Sawayama announced her newest album &#x201C;Hold The Girl&#8221; (out in the fall). The album&#x2019;s first single, &#x201C;This Hell&#8221; was released on May 18. While containing the usual unique pop aspects that Sawayama is praised for, the blend of elements from country music makes the song a euphoric hit. The song is also filled with allusions to mainstream media and pop culture, one lyric even claiming, &#x201C;F*ck what they did to Britney, to Lady Di and Whitney.&#x201D; Ultimately, as Sawayama said in a <a href=\"https:\/\/pitchfork.com\/news\/rina-sawayama-announces-new-album-hold-the-girl-shares-new-song-this-hell-listen\/\">press release<\/a>, the song&#x2019;s message of reclaiming hell and sticking it to prejudice is the best part of the track.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Harry Styles &#x2014; Grapejuice (Recommended by Kyla Figueroa &#x2019;24)&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harry Styles is entering his mainstream-but-feels-indie era, and I am all for it. On May 20, he released his third album, &#8220;Harry&#8217;s House,&#8221; and &#8220;Grapejuice&#8221; began trending on Twitter immediately. The entire album is a must-listen, but the track &#x201C;Grapejuice&#x201D; features funk pop elements emanating the pleasure and charisma Styles is known for. This one feels like falling in love with the same person over and over and over again, never leaving the honeymoon phase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fatboy Slim &#x2014; Praise You (Radio Edit) (Recommended by Chloe Walsh &#x2019;25)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of all the great truths in this world, I believe that there is no happier song in this universe than &#x201C;Praise You&#x201D; by Fatboy Slim. Anyone who loves a good 1990s movie will instantly recognize this from the film &#x201C;Cruel Intentions,&#x201D; and anybody else who loves a good throwback will also already know this one. But whether this is a song you are familiar with and love or one you are just now hearing for the first time, there is an unlimited supply of happiness to go around in that simple piano riff (and in the <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/ruAi4VBoBSM\">music video<\/a>)!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Neighbourhood &#x2014; Devil&#8217;s Advocate (Recommended by Chloe Walsh &#x2019;25)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the only way you know The Neighbourhood is through their hit song &#x201C;Sweater Weather,&#x201D; be prepared for this song to completely swap your perception of the band. The guitar riff in this track is absolutely sick &#x2014; it&#x2019;s catchy, danceable and, above all, cool. I challenge you to listen to this song a couple of times and try not to lip-synch with Jesse Rutherford when he says &#x201C;light speed&#x201D; eight times in a row on beat. The final breakdown at 2:21 when the bass and guitar distortion loudens and hammers the song home is well worth the wait. Caution: I promise you that this song is one that will be on repeat for a while. Don&#x2019;t say I didn&#x2019;t warn you!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Doors &#x2014; Peace Frog (Recommended by Chloe Walsh &#x2019;25)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#x2019;re anything like my dad, you most likely hate The Doors for their &#x201C;god-awful droning organ sound.&#x201D; But, if you&#x2019;re anything like me, you probably think that even though the organ can get a bit much sometimes, The Doors are pretty awesome all things considered. The song hits the ground running with a funky hook that sounds a lot like &#x201C;Jive Talkin&#x2019;&#x201D; by the Bee Gees. This song is a great one to move, walk or strut to &#x2014; wonderful 1970s vibes all around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Better Than Ezra &#x2014; Juicy (Recommended by Chloe Walsh &#x2019;25)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I first heard this song sitting shotgun in my dad&#x2019;s car at three years old, and together we&#x2019;ve been listening to it ever since. I love the falsetto voices in the song, and the ways in which the singer mimics the instruments themselves. It&#x2019;s an instant mood booster of a song, and I hope you can see why we&#x2019;ve loved it for so long!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Beck &#x2014; Girl (Recommended by Chloe Walsh &#x2019;25)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For anyone who doesn&#x2019;t already know &#x2014; Beck is beyond cool. Of course, you can listen to &#x201C;Loser,&#x201D; &#x201C;Think I&#x2019;m In Love&#x201D; or even his feature on the &#x201C;Scott Pilgrim vs. The World&#x201D; soundtrack. But there&#x2019;s something special about &#x201C;Girl&#x201D; that just puts a smile on my face with every listen. Maybe it&#x2019;s the fun little 12-second techno intro that seamlessly transforms into a twangy country-pop beat. Maybe it&#x2019;s the way the chorus repeats &#x201C;my sun-eyed girl&#x201D; &#x2014; a phrase that always makes me smile &#x2014;&nbsp;over and over again. Maybe it&#x2019;s just the fact that this song is three minutes and 29 seconds of infectious joy over a track that sounds like summer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Purr &#x2014; Boy (Recommended by Zach Zafran &#x2019;25)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This song perfectly embodies the feeling of sitting in the shade on a hot summer day. Even though it&#x2019;s spring, we&#x2019;re entering the part of the quarter where sights like fountain hopping, daytime activities and constant music could convince any onlooker that it&#x2019;s already mid-July. &#x201C;Boy&#x201D; starts off with 16 straight drum beats that leave you simultaneously grooving and relaxing, which is the perfect combination for this point of the school year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alex G &#x2014; In My Arms (Recommended by Brandon Rupp &#x2019;25)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An achingly beautiful song, &#x201C;In My Arms&#x201D; represents the best qualities of Alex Giannascoli&#x2019;s songwriting &#x2014; simple yet emotionally dense; vague yet packed with unique imagery. Like everything else on its parent album, &#x201C;House of Sugar,&#8221; this track shows that Alex G has mastered his craft. This track is the perfect soundtrack for a long and cathartic cry session.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Magnetic Fields &#x2014; Smoke and Mirrors (Recommended by Brandon Rupp &#x2019;25)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When songwriter Stephin Merritt&#x2019;s voice finally enters the mix of &#x201C;Smoke and Mirrors,&#x201D; it&#x2019;s always surprising to hear just how well his rich bass vocals fit into the mix of synthesizers and reverberated drum machines. One can only wonder about the strings the Magnetic Fields were pulling behind the scenes to concoct such a beautiful and timeless pop gem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kendrick Lamar &#x2014; Father Time (Recommended by Nick Sligh &#x2019;23)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Father Time is one of the best songs of the past few years and Kendrick Lamar&#8217;s whole career. The lyrics, the chorus from Sampha and the production all combine to make a flawless track addressing Kendrick&#8217;s issues with his father.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ab-Soul &#x2014; Hollandaise (Recommended by Nick Sligh &#x2019;23)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ab-Soul&#8217;s return single comes with an absolutely electrifying presence. &#x201C;Hollandaise&#x201D; saw him display all of his generational talents as a rapper over an extremely captivating beat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pusha T &amp; Kanye West &#x2014; Dreamin of the Past (Recommended by Nick Sligh &#x2019;23)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pusha T and Kanye West deliver another fantastic collaboration &#x2014; this one over a vintage and beautiful Kanye soul sample of Donny Hathaway&#8217;s classic &#x201C;Jealous Guy.&#x201D; The delivery from Push is wonderful, and Kanye&#8217;s verse to close out the song adds depth and heart.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Wong and Cody Fry &#x2014; Golden (Recommended by Michelle Fu &#x2019;24)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a great summer bop! It&#x2019;s high-energy, funky and super catchy. It has a neat instrumental interlude as well. It only caught my eye because I liked the album art, but I&#x2019;m really glad it did.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ricky Montgomery &#x2014; Settle Down (Recommended by Kristofer Roland Nino &#x2019;25)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bright, bubbly and surprisingly heartfelt, &#x201C;Settle Down&#x201D; is Ricky Montgomery&#x2019;s brand new release that feels like a sunny day. Although its lyrics dive into Montgomery&#x2019;s complicated love life, his voice bounces against an infectious drum beat and beautiful backing vocals, creating an experience full of both yearning and warmth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Head and the Heart &#x2014; Rivers and Roads (Recommended by Andrew Gerges &#x2019;25)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In line with my The Head and the Heart pick last month, I heard this song a while ago but had forgotten about it until a recent Stanford International Affairs Society trivia night category was named after it. It&#8217;s a slow song and a bit melancholic, but it aligns with end-of-year sentiments of missing your friends.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Peach Tree Rascals &#x2014; Mariposa (Recommended by Vivian Wang &#x2019;25)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mariposa is my go-to biking song. It&#x2019;s the perfect track if you&#8217;re looking to channel your inner main character energy while biking from your dorm to Main Quad, with the cool spring breeze blowing in your hair. This song translates to &#x201C;butterfly&#x201D; in Spanish, and it&#x2019;s all about learning, growing and improving as a person. Mariposa is a super wholesome song with the perfect summery vibes &#x2014; it&#x2019;ll be on repeat in my AirPods for quite a while. Shoutout to my roommate for sharing this song with me.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rostam &#x2014; 4Runner (Recommended by Malia Mendez &#x2019;22)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with Yoke Lore and Lupin, Rostam is among my favorite solo projects in recent history. 4Runner employs gentle vocals, an unhurried interlude and a rolling acoustic guitar to tell a queer love story steeped in nostalgia. It&#x2019;s a warm welcome to an all-around charming EP, but it&#x2019;s also begging to be added to a beach\/drive playlist. I imagine I&#8217;ll have this gem in my rotation all through summer.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Harry Styles &#x2014; Music For a Sushi Restaurant (Recommended by Kirsten Mettler &#x2019;23)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After reading Victoria&#8217;s Hsieh&#8217;s nuanced <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/05\/24\/harrys-house-is-a-charming-stylish-exploration-of-romance-that-lacks-in-lyricism\/\">review<\/a> of &#x201C;Harry&#x2019;s House,&#x201D; I had to check out the ex-One Direction star&#8217;s latest album. Honestly, most of the songs didn&#8217;t stand out to me, but &#x201C;Music For a Sushi Restaurant&#x201D; got stuck right in my head as a creative pop of sunshine. I played the song over and over on a warm, Sunday afternoon as I headed over to a baseball game, and it felt nothing short of idyllic.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tame Impala and Diana Ross &#x2014; Turn Up The Sunshine (Recommended by Aditeya Shukla &#x2019;23)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the first single of the Minions movie soundtrack with a lineup better stacked than most festivals, Turn Up The Sunshine is an explosion of color.&nbsp;Diana Ross&#x2019; charismatic and saccharine vocals mixed in with Tame Impala&#x2019;s production, almost similar to his &#x201C;Lonerism&#x201D; era, form a song full of joy. The track is filled with 1970s energy but still has shades of contemporary pop music, making it a truly unique listen.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article is a review and includes subjective opinions, thoughts and critiques.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tired of Spotify&#8217;s &#8220;Discover Weekly&#8221; telling you what to listen to?

The Dust Settles\u2019: 4 years in the making, but just the beginning for Kevin Martin \u201922"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Ever since stepping foot on campus, Kevin Martin &#x2019;22 has wanted to release an EP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His arrival at Stanford represented the dawn of a new era in his musical journey. Before college, Martin kept his songwriting hidden from his family, who pushed him to adopt more conventional interests. He always knew, however, that once he got to college, he would pursue music production wholeheartedly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Introduced to the guitar at the age of three and always found singing to himself, Martin has been surrounded by music his whole life. He switched to the double bass in elementary school and quickly became heavily invested in classical music, which lasted all throughout his primary education. Martin was a talented and skilled classical musician from the start, but deep down he knew that he wanted something more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When he got to Stanford, he made a full commitment to music, dropping many of his other interests and hobbies to focus on his true passion. Immediately, he joined an acapella group as well as the Stanford Symphony Orchestra, all while writing and producing more of his own music, doing &#x201C;whatever he could to perform.&#x201D; Martin even incorporated music into his academic life, designing his own major which combined both music and Management Science and Engineering (MS&amp;E). &#x201C;Trying to be a student with non-music goals was hard,&#x201D; Martin said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Martin&#x2019;s life, like everyone else&#x2019;s, was put on pause by the COVID-19 pandemic. He found a silver lining in his situation, however, by taking the period of social isolation as an opportunity to focus on music production. When he came back to campus for his senior year, he went through a breakup, and it ultimately served as a powerful catalyst for him to release his EP &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/5uTALKOlwMsUYMAAvlQ2Cx?si=dDfycNUVT7-J2h__SzgEZA\">When The Dust Settles<\/a>.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Martin doesn&#x2019;t intend to &#x201C;intentionally write about his problems,&#x201D; he admits that his EP was inspired by his recent breakup with his boyfriend. &#x201C;Every time we ended up having a big fight or something, I ended up writing a new song,&#x201D; Martin said. You can feel his emotional passion and intimate connections in each and every song, both in his candid, unfiltered lyrics and mellifluous, slow-paced melodies. When asked about Martin&#x2019;s latest EP, longtime friend Daphne Skiff &#x2019;23 described his songs as &#x201C;extremely personal,&#x201D; going so far as to say that listening to his music &#x201C;even hurts [her]&#x201D; because of how much she cares for him.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;When The Dust Settles&#x201D; isn&#x2019;t just another breakup album, though. Jacob Eisenach &#x2019;22, a close friend of Martin&#x2019;s, remarked that &#x201C;he&#x2019;s got very unique vocals &#x2014; it&#x2019;s hard to describe. At times in the album it&#x2019;s soft and very background, and other times it&#x2019;s this shining light of a sound. Lyrically, he has a rawness and honesty you don&#x2019;t typically see.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Martin combines indie, R&amp;B and soul genres to create his signature sound. His inclusion of synthesized drums and sounds throughout the EP &#x2014; one example of his &#x201C;nerdier interests in production&#x201D; &#x2014; gives his music an otherworldly atmosphere, especially in songs like &#x201C;What Did I Do To Deserve You?&#x201D; and &#x201C;Unexpected.&#x201D; Other songs, such as &#x201C;Heal The Shame,&#x201D; rely more heavily on Martin&#x2019;s powerful, gleaming vocals, sounding almost gospel-like in their melodies. As such, the tracks of &#x201C;When the Dust Settles&#x201D; are quite variable and diverse in terms of style.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though he is influenced by other artists, Martin&#x2019;s music is distinctively his own. &#x201C;This first project was very much just like a journal of thoughts. I don&#x2019;t really care if this sounds like anyone or anything &#x2014; this was just how I was feeling and what sounds accompany that.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now just days away from graduation, Martin&#x2019;s story at Stanford is coming to a close. His musical journey, however, is just getting started. Moving straight to Los Angeles after college, Martin plans to work at a media and entertainment technology consulting firm while continuing to pursue music on the side. When asked about what specific music-related plans he has for the future, Martin responded that he&#x2019;s still trying to figure out the specifics, but that he knows he&#x2019;s going to &#x201C;keep the momentum going.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&#8217;s Note: This article is partly a review and contains some subjective opinions, thoughts and critiques.

places to cry at Stanford"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Have you ever needed to find a place to cry on Stanford&#8217;s campus? Or are your usual crying locations not cutting it for you anymore? As we approach finals week, I&#x2019;ve got you covered: I&#x2019;ve compiled a list and ranked some of the best places for you to let it all out.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Dorm Room &#x2014; ?\/10<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#x2019;re starting the list off with a classic. Dorms are the obvious first choice for places to cry on campus, given their accessibility and clearly defined private spaces. For many students, however, this option isn&#x2019;t viable. Freshmen and sophomores who don&#x2019;t have the greatest relationship with their roommates or students living in the older row houses with notoriously thin walls may not feel comfortable crying in their rooms. Since the reliability of dorm rooms is very context-dependent, we give it a score of ?\/10.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Tanner Philosophy Library &#x2014; 7\/10<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tanner Philosophy Library is located on the first floor of the Philosophy Department (Building 90 in Main Quad). If you&#x2019;re struggling because of academics and feel the need to cry after a class, this library is the one to go to. It&#x2019;s a small, intimate space that sees very few visitors. Compared to other libraries on campus, such as Green or the Engineering Library, you&#x2019;re less likely to run into someone you know (and want to avoid) at Tanner. We give it a 7\/10, however, because there are prettier places on campus to cry than a library.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/HXyTiohTIuterWZOoi3EV91deB7kuW2ZeCsicBFpPFNBC0aZHAVRFaWJQAWf-bRA8K_TCZQMTTnMMEXhQPMWPc06gN2XCODiTx4aJtdJHFxB9uByrxbYN5r4ZdVUtbhkWVRY_psamw-zLli23Q\" alt=\"\" \/><figcaption><em>A look inside Tanner Philosophy Library. (ALLISON ARGUETA\/ The Stanford Daily)<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Lake Lagunita &#x2014; 10\/10<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lake Lag is an empty pit that was once a lake located on West Campus. There are many walkways, benches and fire pits around Lake Lag that would make for excellent outdoor crying locations. It&#x2019;s the perfect place for students who live further away from the main part of campus. While crying at Lake Lag is ideal for scenic views and privacy, there are large parts of the walkways that aren&#x2019;t very well lit. We recommend exercising caution if you choose to cry here at night.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. McMurtry Building Rooftop &#x2014; 7\/10<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The McMurtry Building is located on Roth Way next to the Cantor Arts Building. The best spot to cry at McMurtry is the rooftop terrace, which is accessible by elevator or staircase. It&#x2019;s spacious with lots of places to sit or stand, depending on your crying needs. From the rooftop, you can also get some of the best views on campus for when you need to feel like a main character after you&#x2019;ve finished sobbing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/0Xqev9HuJprabHQbAj7o5G_TIE8329_6CwqYU3oQXvt1FEPjDDzuTrJacnRpsWW0_Ra3xqa0U66_gom82ldJMFe_-68c2LL5yHDcsuVzAIQaZiAtHCX6B12Ib-M7v_un7o3oB66xCXNwNaXUJQ\" alt=\"\" \/><figcaption><em>The view from the McMurtry Building rooftop.

Building 460, Margaret Jacks Hall: Terrace Room Patio &#x2014; 8\/10<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take the elevator up to the fourth floor of Margaret Jacks Hall (Building 460 of Main Quad) to get to the outdoor patio area, which is connected to the Terrace Conference Room. You&#x2019;ll find the patio is private, intimate and perfect for crying. While this is an ideal spot, be sure not to come on days when English Department events are being held in the Terrace Room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/SHUfez8cgcdRQxnsUEkuj0sUZOob_48wpgMdDo58wC1OI0RfeOY7Vy9rGL3H1YBQIKJuz8DJQZ8ABK-MYHj86AhVJMe5FuidM9fOrO0Tr_clgLxMwDJsO9X30LYgDRqSh7ebJvsAaKgswkC23w\" alt=\"\" width=\"840\" height=\"1119\" \/><figcaption><em>Terrace Room Patio. (ALLISON ARGUETA\/ The Stanford Daily)<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. The Arizona Garden &#x2014; 7\/10<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Arizona Garden, also known as The Cactus Garden, is a small botanical cactus and succulent garden located on the south side of the Stanford Family Mausoleum. It is further from the central campus than our other recommendations. Yet we feel it&#x2019;s worth it to travel and cry in one of the prettiest, most unique spots on campus. There are many shady, private benches for crying, and when you feel like you need to calm down, you can take a stroll along one of the garden paths. The Arizona Garden gets major points for privacy and aesthetics, but because of the longer distance, we give it a 7\/10.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/NmX11FlysbyDgaIvxeAhw25kmI7ZQZIDBcTQGHp_1_5EJYfxfKq_EL8TuP9Lcvxy_w2LDJegpuXe1Sld_FSKfxhznWN5WrPU--asnXb0gc6n73hxNmZHwTEkQgTFF5rqBi8CLP9B6302SpzIvA\" alt=\"\" \/><figcaption><em>Arbuckle Dining Pavilion. (ALLISON ARGUETA\/ The Stanford Daily)<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. The Marguerite &#x2014; 9\/10<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oftentimes, when your emotions are too great, it can be difficult to wait until you get to a location to let the tears out. If you feel the need to cry on the move, the Marguerite shuttles are the best form of transportation to cry on. Crying while biking can be dangerous because your vision is significantly impaired. The Caltrain is too crowded to have a real cry. Because the Margueritte buses are an under-utilized campus service, they are often empty. They also run frequently and can take you to a variety of locations on campus once you&#x2019;re feeling better. For accessibility and a chance for privacy, we give it a 9\/10.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8. Old Union Bathrooms &#x2014; 10\/10<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another classic crying location are bathrooms, and the bathrooms at Stanford&#x2019;s student union building, also known as Old Union, are some of the best. Centrally located on campus, the first floor of Old Union has many one-person bathrooms that are clean, spacious and perfect for a long cry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10. The Graduate School of Business: Arbuckle Dining Pavilion &#x2014; 10\/10<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arbuckle Dining Pavilion in The Graduate School of Business is an ideal crying spot for undergraduate students. While this is the most crowded spot on the list, Arbuckle is frequented primarily by business school students, providing undergraduates with anonymity. This is a spot for lower-key cries rather than full-out sobs, but we still recommend checking it out. If you come at the right time, you might catch the end of a business school networking event and be able to take some of the fancy leftovers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>11. The Stanford Daily House &#x2014; 13\/10<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Stanford Daily House, on Panama Mall, is the staff&#x2019;s preferred location for crying. Spacious with many private conference rooms, a continuous stream of snacks and Taylor Swift vinyls on repeat, we enjoy crying here, especially at 3 a.m. We recommend crying in the Editor-In-Chief&#x2019;s office because the walls are essentially soundproof.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/wWKthPhj4Ew64bMbFBLbknfvSlN9F30Tx8_IkDeILEO4HlBiYpxD-VBQL5G00AReSJ78cJH99H_Ewvo5X3r2oeFilBRbLbHGocF7_DspPh7rE59wxZxOYlsyOrafUZiXuiwJk9NVjDNEL9olXw\" alt=\"\" \/><figcaption><em>The Stanford Daily House.

More than 130 years ago, a Chinese man named Jim Mok and a team of Chinese gardeners employed by the Stanfords labored together to plant the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2010\/02\/18\/rooted-in-history\/\">166 palm trees<\/a> that would one day become emblematic of the University.<sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, hundreds of Chinese workers also leveled the terrain, laid building foundations and set up other vital physical infrastructure (including the subterranean <a href=\"https:\/\/stanfordsteamtunnels.wordpress.com\/\">steam tunnels<\/a>) needed for a functioning university campus.<sup>2<\/sup> More than 100 of these workers were <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1080\/00447471.2019.1611344?needAccess=true\">still employed<\/a> in the 1890s, when the <a href=\"https:\/\/125.stanford.edu\/commencement\/\">first students<\/a> matriculated and graduated.<sup>3<\/sup> The fascinating history of Chinese laborers on campus has been unearthed by a dedicated <a href=\"https:\/\/archaeology.stanford.edu\/researchfaculty-projects\/arboretum-chinese-labor-quarters-project\">group of Stanford archaeologists<\/a> working at the Arboretum archaeological site on campus, yet their stories (like too many others) remain largely unknown to students, faculty and alumni &#x2014; and as a result, uncelebrated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is time for the University to definitively acknowledge the contributions of Chinese Americans in its founding and most formative years. We are grateful to the faculty and student researchers who have meticulously documented many of these stories, but it is the University&#x2019;s responsibility as an institution to publicize this history both within the Stanford community and in the public sphere. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From its inception, Stanford University has benefited from the contributions of Asian Americans, including these unsung Chinese workers. Even so, the institution&#x2019;s relationship with Chinese Americans in particular has been anything but straightforward. As the United States concludes its annual celebration of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefing-room\/presidential-actions\/2022\/04\/29\/a-proclamation-on-asian-american-native-hawaiian-and-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2022\/\">Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month<\/a>, it is appropriate to pause and critically examine Stanford&#x2019;s complicated legacy &#x2014; that of Leland Stanford Sr. <em>the man<\/em>, as well as <em>the institution<\/em> he and his wife Jane founded to honor their son, Leland Jr.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leland Stanford Sr. amassed his vast fortune by presiding over the Central Pacific Railroad, as one of the Big Four <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/in-1975-stanford-voted-to-have-its-mascot-be-the-robber-barons-2016-6\">robber barons<\/a> leading the organization. <a href=\"http:\/\/web.stanford.edu\/group\/chineserailroad\/cgi-bin\/website\/\">Chinese laborers<\/a>, primarily from Guangdong, constituted 90% of the company&#x2019;s workforce. They were often assigned the most dangerous work, such as setting off explosives and digging tunnels through unyielding granite.<sup>4<\/sup> When the <a href=\"http:\/\/web.stanford.edu\/group\/chineserailroad\/cgi-bin\/website\/\">transcontinental railroad<\/a> that linked the nation&#x2019;s two coasts was completed in 1869, it was largely due to these workers&#x2019; blood, sweat and tears, despite <a href=\"https:\/\/www.history.com\/news\/transcontinental-railroad-chinese-immigrants\">being compensated significantly less<\/a> than white laborers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet as Professor Gordon Chang <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1080\/00447471.2019.1611344?needAccess=true\">describes<\/a>, Leland Stanford&#x2019;s attitude toward the Chinese was &#x201C;tense, ambivalent and complex.&#x201D;<sup>5<\/sup> Stanford the politician pandered to nativists and embraced anti-Chinese hate as a matter of political expediency. In his <a href=\"https:\/\/governors.library.ca.gov\/addresses\/08-Stanford.html\">inaugural speech<\/a> as Governor of California in January 1862, he said:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>&#8220;To my mind it is clear, that the settlement among us of an inferior race is to be discouraged by every legitimate means. Asia, with her numberless millions, sends to our shores the dregs of her population. &#x2026; There can be no doubt but that the presence among us of numbers of degraded and distinct people must exercise a deleterious influence upon the superior race, and to a certain extent, repel desirable immigration.&#8221;<sup>6<\/sup><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Within a couple years, Stanford&#x2019;s own Central Pacific Railroad Company would be hiring the same despised Chinese labor. Through interactions with his employees, Stanford revised his earlier opinions of the Chinese and admitted that they were intelligent, hardworking and loyal servants.<sup>7<\/sup> Yet as a newly elected U.S. Senator from California, he spoke to Congress in support of additional legislation to curtail the Chinese presence in America, declaring, &#x201C;Chinamen have played an important part in the development of that section of the country by the work they have done in the building up of railroads and in other improvements, as well as manufactures; but the limit of their usefulness has been reached. &#x200B;&#x200B;Not only should no more be allowed to come into the country, but those now here should be gradually returned.&#x201D;<sup>8<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This ambivalence manifested throughout his politics, as he publicly called for federal restrictions on Chinese immigration, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1080\/00447471.2019.1611344?needAccess=true\">endorsed<\/a> the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act barring Chinese laborers from immigrating to the United States and <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2019\/05\/23\/chinese-railroad-workers\/\">affirmed<\/a> the 1892 Geary Act extending these restrictions.<sup>9<\/sup> At the same time, Chinese workers operated and maintained his family <a href=\"https:\/\/sf.curbed.com\/maps\/railroad-whales-were-richer-than-you-could-ever-hope-to-be\">properties<\/a>, including a <a href=\"https:\/\/ohp.parks.ca.gov\/ListedResources\/Detail\/642\">vineyard<\/a>, the Stanford <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/1215385\">mansion<\/a> atop San Francisco&#x2019;s Nob Hill (at the time, the &#x201C;<a href=\"http:\/\/berkeleyheritage.com\/berkeley_landmarks\/good_shepherd.html\">largest private residence<\/a>&#x201D; in the state) and the Palo Alto <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/features\/2014\/year-in-review\/spotlight\/cantor.html\">stock farm<\/a> that eventually became the campus of Stanford University.<sup>10<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this period when anti-Chinese hatred festered in the country, Leland and Jane Stanford did what they could to protect their Chinese employees from outside intimidation and harassment. They even leased some of their land to workers like Jim Mok, who used it to cultivate and sell chrysanthemums to students to earn a bit of extra income. For the Big Game of 1895, a profusion of &#x201C;football mums&#x201D; colored the stands. Stanford students wore large, festive chrysanthemums in red hues pinned to their jackets, while Cal students wore yellow ones, creating a tradition that endured for decades to come.<sup>11<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since its early days, Stanford University has <a href=\"https:\/\/exhibits.stanford.edu\/stanford-stories\/feature\/1890s\">admitted<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/pr\/94\/940621Arc4199.html\">Japanese<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/searchworks.stanford.edu\/catalog?f%5Bcollection%5D%5B%5D=8667913\">Chinese<\/a> students. But this admission was often met with overt racism, reminding us that entrance to an elite institution does not equate to inclusion. When a Chinese freshman attempted to move into the dorms at Encina Hall in 1918, he was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sapaac.org\/s\/Yu_Chinese_Student_Encina.jpeg\">bodily thrown out<\/a> by white students. The outraged Chinese community rallied to fund the construction of a<em> <\/em>clubhouse on campus, where Chinese students could live while studying at Stanford. Chinese students and members of the Chinese business community worked together to buy a house on campus and rebuild it. Originally located on Salvatierra, where the Stanford Law School stands today, the Chinese Clubhouse was torn down in 1971 to make way for more University construction. Just as much of Asian American history has been papered over, the community&#x2019;s tangible heritage on campus was demolished.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Asian American alumni, we look upon Stanford with great affection; yet we must also recall the challenges and injustices the AAPI community has overcome to be part of the University. Recognizing past wrongs, while uncovering and celebrating powerful stories of resilience, is not an indictment of our alma mater. Rather, it is a long-overdue reckoning &#x2014; and an opportunity to initiate healing and forge a stronger sense of collective history. One welcome step would be the installation of a sign on campus to commemorate this history and ensure that it is readily accessible to students, alumni and visitors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crucially, we believe that any act commemorating the Chinese in America is also necessarily an act of reconciliation. Thus, <em>the process undertaken<\/em> is just as important as the end result. This process should be founded on meaningful consultation and active participation of the community being represented. We ask the University to engage with our community and empower us to be co-authors of our own story. Such an approach represents best practices for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nps.gov\/civic\/index.html\">national parks<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sitesofconscience.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/Members_member-Benefits_005.pdf\">historical landmarks<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/sarweb.org\/blog-guidelines-for-collaboration-museums-and-communities-seeking-equitable-change\/\">museums<\/a> across the country and embraces the ethos: <a href=\"https:\/\/artmuseumteaching.com\/2017\/08\/28\/culture-lab-manifesto\/\"><em>Nothing about us, without us.<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stanford administrators can take inspiration from numerous past initiatives honoring Chinese American workers: the Chinese Historical Society of America&#x2019;s plaque <a href=\"https:\/\/chsa.org\/2014\/05\/chsas-history-comes-full-circle-with-chinese-railroad-worker-honors\/\">commemorating<\/a> their critical contribution to the first transcontinental railroad; <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1-nySQ5qadG0sxg4wZKuxctzHZ2m0pfZfx05Q7lI26Ag\/edit?usp=sharing\">other markers<\/a><em> <\/em>honoring the Chinese around North America, with text crafted by our communities in both English and <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1-nySQ5qadG0sxg4wZKuxctzHZ2m0pfZfx05Q7lI26Ag\/edit?usp=sharing\">Traditional Chinese<\/a>; or Stanford&#x2019;s own <a href=\"https:\/\/marketstreet.stanford.edu\">Market Street Chinatown Archaeological Project<\/a> in San Jose, led by Archaeology Center Director Barbara Voss.

If justice, equity, diversity and inclusion truly <a href=\"https:\/\/ideal.stanford.edu\/\">matter to Stanford<\/a>, as Provost Persis Drell asserts, then the University must strive to genuinely engage with the Chinese American community in bringing this history to light.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We urge University leaders to prioritize inclusion and to co-create with communities of color. Avoid tokenistic engagement that does not truly involve communities on matters important to them. Partner with civic groups to develop these narratives into innovative heritage experiences. Through collaboration, the possibilities are boundless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A previous version of this article used a different romanization (Jim Mock) of the gardener&#8217;s name.

href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1i7RSq1QGYn48Rec9Vt3AD-Dds7EQc-sN\/view\">released<\/a> the qualitative results of its first campus-wide Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) survey on Thursday. The qualitative results revealed widespread discriminatory and harassing behaviors on campus affecting communities of color as well as non-binary and transgender individuals on campus.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey, which was conducted in May 2021, asked questions about inclusion and belonging on campus and collected data about community members&#x2019; race, ethnicity and other identities. Around 15,000 students, postdoctoral scholars, faculty and staff members completed the survey, and about 7,000 provided qualitative responses, according to the report.&#xA0;The qualitative results mirror the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2021\/11\/17\/widespread-discriminatory-and-harassing-behaviors-disproportionally-affect-marginalized-groups-on-campus-survey-finds\/\">quantitative data<\/a> published in November, which also revealed widespread discrimination against minority groups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Hearing the voices of our community is both powerful and distressing,&#x201D; Provost Persis Drell <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/report\/2022\/05\/26\/qualitative-data-released-2021-dei-survey\/?utm_source=Stanford+ALL&amp;utm_campaign=70b59dd427-uggrad_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_c042b4aad7-70b59dd427-55101742\">told<\/a> the Stanford Report on Thursday. The provost <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/report\/2021\/05\/12\/stanford-diversity-equity-inclusion-survey-now-open\/\">commissioned<\/a> the survey as part of the school&#x2019;s ongoing Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Access in a Learning Environment (<a href=\"https:\/\/ideal.stanford.edu\/\">IDEAL<\/a>) initiative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In total, 50% of Black respondents, 46% of American Indian or Alaska Native respondents and 42% of Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander respondents reported finding one or more communities, groups or spaces on campus where they feel marginalized or excluded.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I have never felt as socially isolated, otherized or set apart because of my race as I have at Stanford,&#x201D; one Black staff member wrote. &#x201C;Here at Stanford, I feel as if my racial identity walks into the room before me and everything else is judged through that lens.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Hispanic graduate student wrote in the survey that despite their academic achievements, they question whether they made the right choice by coming to Stanford. They described Stanford as an &#8220;incredibly lonely place&#8221; and wrote that they are &#8220;happy to be leaving soon.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around 63% of Black respondents reported experiencing at least one microaggression, followed by 45% of American Indian or Alaska Native and 43% of Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander community members, according to the survey results.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I am frequently harassed by police on campus,&#x201D; a Black graduate student wrote in the survey. &#x201C;People in lab buildings stop and question me at night, assuming I don&#x2019;t belong.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Black graduate student&#x2019;s experience is reflective of a broader sense of differential treatment by campus police and security toward marginalized communities, according to the report.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DEI survey also found that women, transgender, non-binary and gender questioning individuals have experienced the highest levels of harassing behaviors. More than one in five women respondents and 46% of transgender respondents reported experiencing at least one harassing behavior in the last two years by someone associated with Stanford.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;If you are a man that brings money to the University, you can do whatever you want,&#x201D; a woman faculty member responded in the survey. &#x201C;I had such a man push his leg against mine under the table at one of my faculty interview dinners. I just let him do it, what could I do?&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An undergraduate student who identifies as first generation and low-income wrote about the demeaning experience she faces in Greek life: &#x201C;Fraternity men recognize me as in a sorority and call me a cheap slut and offer to pay me to sleep with them.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the discriminatory and harassing behaviors directed toward marginalized communities, very few ultimately made a formal report to the University about these experiences, according to the report.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many respondents cited a fear of retaliation and a lack of accountability in Stanford&#x2019;s disciplinary processes. In particular, respondents wrote that complaints are often not met with a meaningful response and action is only taken by University officials when under extreme pressure.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s also hard to hold my supervisor accountable if the response the faculty director gave me when I raised concerns is &#x2014; &#x2018;get thicker skin&#x2019; and &#x2018;don&#8217;t be so sensitive,&#x2019;&#x201D; a woman staff member wrote.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Respondents recommended a range of actions that the University should take to improve the campus environment, including increasing diversity across all populations, improving reporting and accountability and improving support for people from marginalized identities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;We hope these accounts will serve as learning opportunities of what harmful behaviors look like, and the impact they have on members of our community so they can be avoided in the future,&#x201D; said Vice Provost for Institutional Equity, Access and Community Patrick Dunkley in the Stanford Report <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/report\/2022\/05\/26\/qualitative-data-released-2021-dei-survey\/?utm_source=Stanford+ALL&amp;utm_campaign=70b59dd427-uggrad_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_c042b4aad7-70b59dd427-55101742\">article<\/a>.&#xA0;&#x201C;This

fossil fuel companies has reached a fever pitch across campus. Intensifying calls for Stanford to establish a bright-line stance, divest from these companies and refuse their donations have dampened a historic moment at the University: the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/05\/06\/school-of-sustainability-receives-1-1-billion-donation-from-john-doerr\/\">launch<\/a> of a new School of Sustainability funded by a record $1.1 billion donation from philanthropists John and Ann Doerr.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In interviews following the announcement, administrators, including incoming dean <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/05\/23\/who-is-arun-majumdar-incoming-sustainability-school-dean-has-a-history-of-embracing-industry-partnerships\/\">Arun Majumdar<\/a>, have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/05\/04\/climate\/john-doerr-stanford-climate.html\">stood firm<\/a> on two stances over which they have faced criticism: the school will work with and accept donations from fossil fuel companies and will not engage in political advocacy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new school, which is set to launch on Sept. 1, <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/2022\/05\/04\/stanford-doerr-school-sustainability-universitys-first-new-school-70-years-will-accelerate-solutions-global-climate-crisis\/\">aims<\/a> to accelerate solutions to the global climate crisis. The school will have a <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/2022\/05\/04\/stanford-doerr-school-sustainability-universitys-first-new-school-70-years-will-accelerate-solutions-global-climate-crisis\/\">distinctive<\/a> three-part structure that brings about 90 existing faculty to the its academic departments, bridges areas of scholarship through interdisciplinary institutes and establishes an accelerator to drive policy and technology solutions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The school will also be willing to work with and accept donations from fossil fuel companies, according to Majumdar, who has <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/05\/23\/who-is-arun-majumdar-incoming-sustainability-school-dean-has-a-history-of-embracing-industry-partnerships\/\">consistently emphasized<\/a> that industry collaboration is necessary to solve the climate crisis. The decision is in line with the University&#x2019;s continued <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/2016\/04\/25\/stanford-climate-change-statement-board-trustees\/\">refusal<\/a> to divest from fossil fuels, despite growing <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/05\/12\/from-the-community-stanford-has-a-chance-at-a-real-school-of-sustainability-if-it-refuses-fossil-fuel-meddling\/\">criticism<\/a> from some <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2021\/11\/15\/opinion-stanford-its-past-time-to-divest\/\">students<\/a> and faculty. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recently, the Board of Trustees <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/06\/12\/stanford-will-not-divest-from-fossil-fuels-board-of-trustees-decides\/\">rejected<\/a> a resolution to divest from publicly-traded oil and natural gas companies in June 2020, while an increasing number of peer institutions, such as Harvard, have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thecrimson.com\/article\/2021\/9\/10\/divest-declares-victory\/\">committed<\/a> to divestment.&nbsp;The campus group Fossil Free Stanford (FFS) also joined with the Climate Defense Project (CDP) to <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/02\/16\/climate-defense-project-and-fossil-free-stanford-file-legal-complaint-against-stanford\/\">file<\/a> a legal complaint against Stanford, contending that, by refusing to divest, the University is shirking its duty as a public charitable corporation to promote the public interest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Given all the evidence we have of climate change, and how it affects marginalized communities, communities of color, less developed countries, you can&#8217;t really support accepting donations from fossil fuel companies,&#x201D; said FFS advocate Isabel Sofia Vil&#xE1; Ortiz &#x2019;25.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, the school&#8217;s launch has earned praise from some who see the sustainability school as a step in the right direction, albeit with room for improvement. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Benjamin Franta, a Ph.D. candidate in the history of science, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/benfranta\/status\/1521906360463466496?s=12&amp;t=jKfSsVGhdqMWGwnM0pVEFg\">commended <\/a>the school for not relying on oil funding in its initial $1.1 billion investment. As a researcher and director of accountability research for the Climate Social Science Network, Franta studies the history of fossil fuel companies and climate change politics. He stressed that the school&#x2019;s initial funding represents a positive shift from the status quo &#x2013; many of Stanford&#x2019;s energy and climate centers have <a href=\"https:\/\/stanfordpolitics.org\/2021\/01\/31\/conflict-of-interests-fossil-fuel-money-in-environmental-research-at-stanford\/\">historically relied<\/a> on fossil fuel funds &#x2013; and said that this school offers Stanford the opportunity to dilute its dependence on such funding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;It sort of proves that you don&#8217;t need fossil fuel money to do climate-related research,&#x201D; Franta said. &#x201C;There is enough money out there.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fourth-year Ph.D. student in Earth Systems Science Marius von Essen echoed Franta&#x2019;s sentiments, adding that continuing to accept fossil fuel donations could incur significant reputational damage on the school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m talking [about] future talent going to that school,&#x201D; Essen said. &#x201C;Stanford has a stellar reputation so there&#8217;ll be people coming to Stanford regardless. But I think there&#8217;s also a new generation of scholars and students entering the workforce that is more critical around these things.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Majumdar has continued to stand by the school&#x2019;s funding plans. The new dean believes that solutions to sustainability challenges are lengthy and require collaborative efforts across academic, government and industry fields. &#x201C;In the future of sustainability, no single institution can do it,&#x201D; he told The Daily. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s all about partnerships.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that the process of decarbonization is a &#x201C;humongous&#x201D; transition that &#x201C;doesn&#x2019;t happen automatically,&#x201D; and that partnerships with fossil fuel companies remain a subject of debate among faculty. The school will aim to work with oil and gas companies that share its goal of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and decarbonizing the economy, &#x201C;not just in words, but in action,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;You need coalition[s] to address the issues of who&#x2019;s representing certain communities.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind the scenes, Majumdar has been working to set a tone of trust and inclusion among sustainability school faculty members. In an <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.stanford.edu\/news\/message-arun-majumdar-looking-forward\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/sustainability.stanford.edu\/news\/message-arun-majumdar-looking-forward\">email<\/a> to the Earth Systems Department, Majumdar wrote that he does not believe the school should work with companies that deny climate change, undermine government policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions or misuse their partnership with the school&#x2019;s sustainability mission. He noted that some companies may still need to produce oil or gas to avoid &#x201C;significant disruptions to human welfare,&#x201D; but that the school will remain &#x201C;vigilant that their values align with ours.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Companies committed to fighting climate change that have transnational scale, industrial know-how and financial resources should be welcome allies in this fight,&#x201D; Majumdar wrote in the email. &#x201C;They can enable innovations and breakthroughs in academia, which are invariably at the laboratory-scale, to be rapidly scaled up for global impact.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the school follows through with its plans, much will be at stake, including upholding transparency in academic research. The University has several safeguards in place to maintain transparency and academic independence, according to Majumdar. Per the University&#x2019;s <a href=\"https:\/\/doresearch.stanford.edu\/policies\/research-policy-handbook\/conflicts-commitment-and-interest\/faculty-policy-conflict-commitment-and-interest\">academic agreement<\/a>, faculty will direct research independently and disclose all funding in published results, Majumdar said.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, Ortiz emphasized the need for transparency in the new school&#x2019;s donations, saying that a lack of transparency could lead others to believe that the University&#x2019;s decisions are unethical. Stanford community members and people across the world &#x201C;should have access to the information of where these funds come from,&#x201D; she said, because without it, &#x201C;it&#8217;s hard to really know the magnitude of these donations and how they affect research.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To maintain the school&#x2019;s independence, Majumdar also said that the school will abstain from political advocacy. According to Majumdar, the best way to ensure long-term viability and maximum impact from the school is to offer information and resources to researchers, policymakers and other stakeholders while avoiding direct advocacy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For fourth-year Ph.D. student in material science and engineering Rachel Huang, the school&#x2019;s mission to provide crucial information to policymakers presents a much-needed opportunity for impact. &#x201C;It&#8217;s very good that there&#8217;s more towards the policymaking side also incorporated into [the school],&#x201D; Huang said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But others see the school&#x2019;s unwillingness to engage in political advocacy as out of touch with real-world consequences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I think the narrative that this is somehow an apolitical school &#x2013; that we focus on the science and somehow leave out policymaking or politics &#x2013; seems to be either naive or disingenuous, because every action has some political agenda, for better or for worse,&#x201D; Taimur Ahmad M.A. &#x2019;23 said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Majumdar stressed that the school&#x2019;s work will stay grounded in issues of equity, justice and diversity of perspective. &#x201C;I believe in public service,&#x201D; he told The Daily. &#x201C;The president has a goal each morning, which is [to support]&nbsp;underrepresented and marginalized communities. All of that&#8217;s part of my work.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet some individuals see a more complicated picture, pointing to what they see as a lack of attention given to justice and equity in Stanford&#x2019;s sustainability efforts. In a statement to The Daily, the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ejstanford.com\/ej-working-group.html\"> Environmental Justice (EJ) Working Group Coordinating Council<\/a>, comprising a team of over thirty faculty, staff and student representatives, said that environmental justice faculty and expertise should be included in Stanford&#x2019;s sustainability practices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ejstanford.com\/timeline.html\">For years<\/a>, we have been asking for more EJ faculty expertise and for their work to be central to all sustainability efforts at Stanford in order to serve student demand and our neighboring communities, all to no avail,&#x201D; they wrote. &#x201C;We have put forward<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ejstanford.com\/new-school-focused-on-sustainability.html\"> multiple proposals<\/a> and have asked time and time again for a seat at the table. We are counting on new leadership to reconsider who gets a say in defining what our &#x2018;sustainability solutions&#x2019; will look like&#x2014;who benefits and how from the new school and its funding.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a statement to The Daily, University spokesperson Karla Hudson wrote that Stanford &#x201C;value[s] the contributions of the faculty, staff and students in the EJ Working Group Coordinating Council&#x201D; and shares &#x201C;the commitment to addressing environmental inequalities and creating more equitable access to environmental benefits.&#x201D; Hudson added that these contributions led to the formation of the new <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.stanford.edu\/departments\/institutes-and-initiatives\">Institute for Sustainable Societies<\/a>, an interdisciplinary collaboration focused on fighting sustainability challenges within the Doerr School.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;As the new Doerr School begins to take shape, we look forward to continued conversations with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ejstanford.com\/ej-working-group.html\">EJ Working Group Coordinating Council<\/a> and the many stakeholders who care deeply about environmental justice as we work to develop a diverse community of scholars,&#x201D; Hudson wrote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the growing criticisms, others painted a more optimistic view of the school. Huang said the new school will bring &#x201C;exciting&#x201D; research opportunities for students and faculty.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I am someone that works in the area of battery [materials] and towards the goal of a more sustainable future,&#x201D; Huang said, &#x201C;so it&#8217;s definitely exciting to see Stanford&#8217;s taking a bigger initiative in setting up a new school.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On social media, some students and faculty also expressed excitement about the launch of the school.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">S.O.S. is a great and apt acronym for our new School of Sustainability! <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/emKCoUnbRF\">https:\/\/t.co\/emKCoUnbRF<\/a><\/p>&mdash; Ge Wang (@gewang) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/gewang\/status\/1521971383705608193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 4, 2022<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Very exciting time here at Stanford for those in the sustainability realm!

In fact, a lot of times it can be the opposite,&#x201D; Kim said. &#x201C;My department is looking at methane &#x2026; [which] could be used for things like bioplastic production or fishmeal.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kim added that though many researchers understand the urgency of climate change and the need to transition to renewable energy, people are still too reliant on fossil fuels to completely abandon them. He said conversing with stakeholders toward a broader mission of sustainability would prove most effective for the school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;This new school is not going to change everything overnight. If the next day all fossil fuels instantly vanished from the earth, our society would collapse,&#x201D; Kim said. &#x201C;There are multiple ways and opportunities in which fossil fuel money could enhance research that is advancing sustainability.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Majumdar has repeatedly maintained that the school will only work with corporate donors who have demonstrated a commitment to making their practices more sustainable. But whether fossil fuel companies can be trusted to transition to more sustainable models is murkier, according to Franta.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;There isn&#8217;t really any evidence that &#x2026; these companies are trying to change,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;There&#8217;s actually a lot of evidence that they&#8217;re not changing.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Franta encouraged students and community members to apply pressure to Stanford given the &#x201C;high stakes&#x201D; involved for society and the environment. &#x201C;We have to continue watching what happens,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Students and faculty and others should keep scrutinizing how the new school does its work and who it takes money from.&#x201D;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Stanford

in Literature: From colonialism to the 21st century in Natasha Brown\u2019s \u2018Assembly\u2019"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>I boarded the 14-hour flight back home for spring break with just one backpack. I had fit a coat in the bag for the snowy weather that would welcome me once we landed. With the coat, my laptop, all the documents you have to carry as an international student and hand sanitizers, I didn&#x2019;t have a lot of space left &#x2014; but I had to have a book. I managed to fit Natasha Brown&#x2019;s 112-page debut novel, &#x201C;Assembly.&#x201D; Don&#x2019;t let the novella&#x2019;s brevity deceive you, because those 112 pages were enough for Brown to convey a compelling story, disheartening yet relatable for far too many people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Assembly&#x201D; is the story of its Black, British narrator, an Oxbridge graduate who works at a finance firm. The novel captures a critical period in her life where disruptive moments, both good and bad, come one after the other. She receives a promotion and is bombarded at the firm by comments of being a &#x201C;diversity hire.&#x201D; At the same time, she gets invited to her boyfriend&#x2019;s parents&#x2019; garden-party and encounters the life of the white and rich like never before. Despite having known how much of a difference privilege can make in one&#x2019;s life, walking into a world vastly different from hers makes this reality especially tangible. On top of everything, she is diagnosed with cancer and has to make a decision regarding her treatment. Although this sudden revelation is likely to immediately panic readers, the narrator&#x2019;s response is more emotionally ambiguous &#x2014; it reads as if this disease is not a shocking revelation, but rather part of the many struggles she&#x2019;s been dealing with forever.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The book opens up with the narrator giving an influential speech to school children. She had grown up in dire circumstances in a country that never treated her as one of its own, but had made it to a prestigious school and now a prestigious position at work. Higher social class had given her a platform &#x2014; a voice that certainly did not feel like her own &#x2014; and now she feels pressured by the expectation to inspire others to be like her, too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;How many women and girls have I lied to? How many have seen my grinning face advocating for this or that firm, or this industry, or that university, this life?&#x201D; Brown writes, portraying the narrator&#x2019;s internal conflict as she inspires kids to build their future. Yet she knows the future she is preaching is far detached from her own skin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brown voices the narrator&#x2019;s frustration with having to abandon her roots to progress in social class. While the narrator feels she has to make this progress &#x2014; she finally has the opportunities that her ancestors did not &#x2014; she is guilt-ridden for losing crucial parts of her identity by blending into a different culture. Her guilt only grows as she is asked to make school children follow her own footsteps. She realizes the absurdity of advising kids to live life as if it&#x2019;s a fight for reputation and class, a wicked game of snakes and ladders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#x2019;t believe Brown&#x2019;s aim with the novella was to expose a deeply corrupt system, but to show the painful experience of being assimilated into a culture. She crafts a protagonist who is slowly disintegrating within a world that demands her labor, only to add to a system that further oppresses her. Our narrator feels how she is losing a piece of her identity to make it out in the world. &#x201C;I am what we&#x2019;ve always been to the empire: pure, fucking profit. A natural resource to exploit and exploit, denigrate, and exploit,&#x201D; writes Brown.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The narrator calls this experience a &#x201C;crushing objecthood&#x201D; and her own &#x201C;dehumanization.&#x201D; The assimilation, like her cancer, spreads and takes over her body. Her cells turn against her; her body becomes her rival. The experience echoes the way her identity shifted to fit the expectations of others, how her persona deviated to belong in an artificial big-corp culture, how she worked to please a government that did not value her. Despite being British, she faces the reality of being considered &#x201C;the other&#x201D; by her own people as a result of her race, a phenomenon Aim&#xE9; Cesaire coined as &#x201C;thingification&#x201D; while <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/j.ctt9qfkrm?turn_away=true\">describing the life of colonized people<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I am talking about societies drained of their essence, cultures trampled underfoot, institutions undermined, lands confiscated, religions smashed, magnificent artistic creations destroyed, extraordinary possibilities wiped out,&#x201D; writes Cesaire in the &#x201C;Discourse on Colonialism,&#x201D; published in 1955. We can see how the loss he describes, experienced by colonized people, is relevant today for generations of people grieving over their loss of culture and facing the same racist rhetoric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Dissolve yourself into the melting pot. And then flow out, pour into the mold. Bend your bones until they splinter and crack and you fit.&#x201D; writes Brown.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The narrator is so appalled by this demand to ascend that her clear frustration reflects in other parts of her life, such as her relationship and her cancer treatment. Brown presents her audience with a question the narrator has been grappling with; before the readers get the chance to take it in, however, the narrator has already come to a conclusion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, the book&#x2019;s brevity is purposeful and appropriate. The narrator&#x2019;s mind is set and it doesn&#x2019;t take too many pages to convey her thoughts. As her reality is exposed, readers will be able to understand why her final decision in the book was quick, easy and unequivocal. In so few pages, Brown establishes her protagonist, immerses the readers in her life and crafts a farewell that allows the protagonist to regain agency and detach herself from the expected narrative of upward movement. Although the ending feels abrupt and the novel is short, it conveys that one does not need any more words to reflect people&#x2019;s need to escape from a society that has forever exploited their labor and abolished their identities.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout, Brown&#x2019;s prose stands out for its brevity and clarity; however, there are also chapters in which she is more lyrical. She provides small yet vivid descriptions of setting to convey the protagonists&#x2019; phenomenological experience and writes brief streams of consciousness that read like poetry. With a clear and compelling prose, Brown&#x2019;s debut called to be finished in one setting and left me wondering &#x2014; as an international student about to land in a city that still felt like a stranger&#x2019;s home &#x2014; how much I belonged or could ever belong there.

the inaugural Pac-12 Baseball Tournament on Sunday. The win extends Stanford&#x2019;s winning streak to 16 games, which is the second-longest active winning streak in college baseball.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Sunday evening, Stanford got off to a hot start against the Beavers. Junior DH Brett Barrera, the Pac-12 leader in batting average, hit an RBI single in the bottom of the first inning to give the Cardinal a 1-0 lead. Later in the inning, outfielder Braden Montgomery, the Pac-12 Freshman of the Year, hit a two-run home run to center field to extend Stanford&#x2019;s lead to 3-0.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the fourth inning, Oregon State put up a rally to cut into the lead. The Beavers loaded the bases after sophomore pitcher Drew Dowd gave up a walk, an out, a single and another walk in order. Then, Dowd threw a wild pitch to put the Beavers on the scoreboard. Shortly thereafter, Beavers&#x2019; left fielder Greg Fuchs grounded out to first base, which plated another run for Oregon State. Dowd, however, was able to get a strikeout that ended the inning and limited the Beavers&#8217; damage to just two runs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the bottom of the fourth, Stanford got those two runs back, as sophomore infielder Carter Graham hit a single through the right side, which scored junior outfielder Brock Jones and junior shortstop Adam Crampton.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Beavers responded again in the fifth inning when DH Jacob Melton, the Pac-12 Player of the Year, hit an RBI single past the shortstop. The single scored two runs and kept the Beavers in striking distance with just a one-run deficit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Melton assisted his team again in the seventh inning, when he hit a single to first base that helped score right fielder Wade Meckler from second. The run tied the game at five apiece.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But once again, Stanford showcased its prolific power-hitting in clutch situations. In the bottom of the seventh inning, sophomore third baseman Drew Bowser hit a solo home run to right center, which put the Cardinal on top once again, 6-5. The blast marked Bowser&#x2019;s fourth home run in four games at the Pac-12 tournament.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later in the inning, Crampton hit a double to left center, which brought sophomore infielder Tommy Troy home from first base. In the eighth, Troy hit a two-run home run to add extra insurance to Stanford&#x2019;s lead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These were the final runs of the game, as Stanford held on to win 9-5.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the game, Bowser and Crampton were named to the All-Tournament Team due to their outstanding play throughout the tournament. In four games, Bowser went 8-18 with four home runs and two doubles, while Crampton went 7-15 with a double and played strong defense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since their regular season resumed, the Cardinal will now host a Regional at Sunken Diamond, and they will be guaranteed to host a Super Regional if they advance. Stanford is the No. 1 seed in the Regional and the No. 2 overall seed in the entire tournament.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, Stanford will host No. 2 seed Texas State (43-12, 26-4 Sun Belt), No. 3 seed UC Santa Barbara (43-12, 27-3 Big West) and No. 4 seed Binghamton (22-28, 15-15 America East) in the Palo Alto Regional.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In college baseball, the Regional round features a double-elimination tournament format, while Super Regionals have a series format.&nbsp;The Cardinal will play Binghamton in their first game of the Regional. First pitch is scheduled for 1 p.m. PT on Friday, June 3.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On Sunday, No. 3 Stanford baseball took down No. 4 Oregon State to win the inaugural Pac-12 Baseball Tournament.

&#x2014;&nbsp;for a variety of reasons. Lily Nilipour &#x2019;22 wanted to live in a place that is intentional about community. Similarly, Cat Clark &#x2019;20 M.S. &#x2019;22 was attracted to the small but tight-knit community of the house. Ravichandra Tadigadapa &#x2019;22 M.S.&#x2019;23 liked the international theme, while Ishira Fernando &#x2019;21 M.S.&#x2019;22 ended up in Hammarskj&#xF6;ld by chance. Sarah Nader &#x2019;15 M.S. &#x2019;16 and Robert Carrera &#x2019;15 M.S. &#x2019;17 wanted to live among the house&#8217;s upperclassmen, whom they looked up to. And Naree Chan &#x2019;06 loved the cleanliness of the house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But all of them left the residence with the same feeling: so much love for Hammarskj&#xF6;ld.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cooperative houses (co-ops) like Hammarskj&#xF6;ld are different from traditional student residence halls. They are student-managed residences where house members share responsibilities for house activities and cooperate in house governance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the purchasing of food and supplies to coordination of jobs and budgeting of finances, Hammarskj&#xF6;ld residents, who are both international and non-international students, join hands in the operation of the house, which often makes residents feel more at home in Hammarskj&#xF6;ld than traditional student residences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hammarskj&#xF6;ld opened in the 1972-73 academic year, meaning that the next academic year will mark the house&#x2019;s 50th anniversary. Several international students, with the help of the Bechtel International Center, set up the international co-op. Named after former United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj&#xF6;ld, the house was intended as a place to nurture differences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For both Nilipour, who is from San Diego, and Clark, who is from Delaware, the house was a space where they encountered different perspectives and cuisines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Hammarskj&#xF6;ld, Nilipour got to have&nbsp;discussions that broadened her perspective beyond the western, American way of thinking. &#x201C;It is great to have a lot of people in the house who discenter my perspective,&#x201D; she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clark said that the dining room was her favorite part of the house. It was where she made memories eating food from different cultures that were made by other residents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fernando from Sri Lanka also recounts learning to have meaningful conversations from the Hammarskj&#xF6;ld people. He believes that the house is &#x201C;markedly different to most other residential spaces on campus&#x201D; because starting a conversation in Hammarskj&#xF6;ld with anyone in the house on a busy weekday is incredibly easy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve talked to people here about the climate, biodiversity loss, coming out, the children of venture capitalists, lost zip cars and much, much more,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;These conversations have genuinely been some of the best in my life.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hammarskj&#xF6;ld&#x2019;s commitment to the international theme creates a space to have conversations about issues relevant to Stanford&#x2019;s international community with both kinship and non-judgment, according to Fernando. &#x201C;The beauty of the house is that due to the constant conversations that are had in the house about being an international house, even the non-internationals in the house are cognizant and understanding of the challenges of international students.&#x201D; For Fernando, living in Hammarskj&#xF6;ld feels like living with a family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And families do really start in Hammarskj&#xF6;ld. Just this month, former residents Carrera and Nader got married.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The couple hosted their Rehearsal Dinner at the backyard of Hammarskj&#xF6;ld with a whole table just for Hammarskj&#xF6;ld residents. They even served a special cocktail named &#x201C;Hammbrosia&#x201D; for the guests. &#x201C;It was amazing to be back in the house,&#x201D; said Nader. She said she was happy to &#x201C;celebrate a special moment at a special place.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As students in Hammarskj&#xF6;ld, Carrera and Nader remember doing chores and cooking together. Now, as husband and wife, they appreciate everything they learned during their time as Hammarskj&#xF6;ld residents. At Hammarskj&#xF6;ld, they learned how to operate a house &#x2014; and now the house is their own shared home.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chan is also married to a fellow Hammarskj&#xF6;ld resident. She remembers meeting her husband for the first time during a Thanksgiving celebration in the house.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Hamm-2006-Olympics.jpg?w=800\" alt=\"A group of students smile and pose outside, around three trees. \" class=\"wp-image-1204820\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Hamm-2006-Olympics.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Hamm-2006-Olympics.jpg?resize=600,450 600w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Hamm-2006-Olympics.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Hamm-2006-Olympics.jpg?resize=1200,900 1200w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Hamm-2006-Olympics.jpg?resize=800,600 800w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Hamm-2006-Olympics.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Hamm-2006-Olympics.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><figcaption><em>The residents of Hammarskj&#xF6;ld competed in the Hamm Olympics in 2006.

From the Hamm Olympics and Halloween to the Talent Show, the house is in a &#x201C;fun and festive&#x201D; mood throughout the year, she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Hammarskj&#xF6;ld remains a space in which people come together and view themselves as citizens of one world, according to Tadigadapa, who is one of the house&#8217;s resident assistants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, the house has celebrated Mid-Autumn Festival, Lunar New Year and Mardi Gras, among other holidays. On top of celebrations, all of the residents did an individual spotlight that revealed something from their background, culture and interests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tadigadapa said that Hammarskj&#xF6;ld could work to make the house and its community more accessible to everybody on campus. As a &#x201C;proud Hammarskj&#xF6;ld,&#x201D; he said that he is excited about what the future holds for the house.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Stanford&#8217;s international student co-op  opened in the 1972-73 academic year, meaning that the next academic year will mark the house\u2019s 50th anniversary.

play is the thing"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Stanford is a social construct. Well, pretty much everything in our everyday lives is a construct. Careers. Government. Money. School. Gender. So on and so forth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I first fully grasped what a &#x201C;social construct&#x201D; is last quarter, when I took the SOC 4: &#x201C;The Sociology of Music.&#x201D; Before then, it was just something Twitter and TikTok memes turned into a buzzword. <em>(Why can&#x2019;t we just print more money?!) <\/em>A social construct, though, according to my professor Dr. Forrest Stuart, is &#x201C;an idea that has been created and accepted by people in society.&#x201D; Rules and norms do not exist inside a vacuum; they are molded by different contexts, like clay on a turntable. We shape and create our societies, our very hands crafting what we live by and our futures forever imprinted by any swipe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is subconscious &#x2014; it is a mutual agreement to live by the norms we have laid, to suspend our rebellion, our disbelief and take part in the performance that is life. Everything we live in is fake. Nothing is real. We made it all up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, fallacy does not exempt us from any sort of consequence, nor does it omit significance. We don&#x2019;t just print more money, unfortunately, because that would lead to the fall of our (already broken and inevitably doomed anyways) economic system. We don&#x2019;t wear white dresses to a wedding, even though we are capable of doing so, because that would offend the bride. If you arrived naked to work one day, you would get a lot of weird looks and most likely a call from HR. U.S. presidents are elected through the (broken and doomed) electoral college. The Neighborhood system determines our housing (and depletes our chances of drawing into a Row House) even though it doesn&#x2019;t make any sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These social constructs are also what create privilege and disparity; if you are not at the top of the system, the model of success, you are &#x201C;othered&#x201D; by said system. There are reasons people can coast through life without a worry, live in bliss and not <em>have <\/em>to think about anything deeper than what&#x2019;s presented to them. They skim the surface of reality; they can judge the book by its cover and get the whole story. It&#x2019;s freedom. It&#x2019;s just life. Live, laugh and love.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other topic that struck me the most in SOC 4 was <a href=\"https:\/\/socialsci.libretexts.org\/Bookshelves\/Sociology\/Introduction_to_Sociology\/Book%3A_Sociology_(Boundless)\/05%3A_Social_Interaction\/5.01%3A_Understanding_Social_Interaction\/5.1C%3A_Dramaturgy#:~:text=Developed%20by%20American%20sociologist%20Erving,were%20performers%20on%20a%20stage.\">the Dramaturgical Metaphor<\/a>, a concept coined by Sociologist Erving Goffman. Essentially, we, as people, as aforementioned, are in a subconscious constant state of performance that can change second by second. There is no such thing as outward authenticity; our every breath, every move, every step, every interaction is crafted and manufactured to match the socially constructed context we live in. We perform different roles on different stages for different audiences, and some performances are acceptable only for some stages and audiences, while others are not. Thus, without realizing it, we&#x2019;re always in motion, always adapting our persona to be appealing and considered normal. (To English Literature and theater enthusiasts &#x2014; think &#x201C;Hamlet.&#x201D;)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back to our beloved college, Leland Stanford Junior University: it, like many elite universities, is a product of social constructions. It is a &#x201C;stage&#x201D; where students are admitted, the systems in place leading most to come from nice (wealthier) families, expected to have specific accords to their name and high intelligence. (I&#x2019;d say a 1600 SAT score, but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/the-racist-origins-of-the-sat\">eugenics<\/a> is not swag.) Beyond that, Stanford has perfectly trimmed grass, lawns and outdoor escapes for lounging in California sun, nice <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/wonk\/wp\/2016\/01\/15\/the-inequality-of-sidewalks\/\">sidewalks<\/a>, flora and trees suitable for walks and too-quiet nights that make it easy to sleep all the way through. These features are what students are used to given their background. Fancy shopping areas and overpriced restaurants for brunch (and brunch in general) are the norm for many. While everyone has to adjust to college, adapting to Stanford culture for some is getting used to a similar version of what&#x2019;s back home. It&#x2019;s familiar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/06\/24\/the-invisible-minority-fli-students-and-online-learning\/#:~:text=feel%20the%20Stanford%20faculty%20had%20been%20accommodating%20of%20their%20circumstances.&amp;text=While%20Stanford%20reports%20that%2047,to%20many%20students%20and%20faculty.\">For the 17% of students<\/a> who identify as first-generation, low-income (FLI), it&#x2019;s not familiar. This bliss and ability to saunter through life is a new thing. It&#x2019;s a culture shock that students experience &#x2014; and I have experienced &#x2014; from the very moment we step foot on this campus and every second afterward. It&#x2019;s there when you realize you don&#x2019;t have to fall asleep to the rhythm and melody of gunshots and car screeches. It&#x2019;s there when computer rooms are filled with Apple devices. It&#x2019;s there when you are no longer the top in the class, and even behind compared to others. It&#x2019;s there when the food that the school provides is nutritious and edible &#x2014; and&nbsp;for some, it&#x2019;s there when the disbelief hits that there&#x2019;s food on the table. It&#x2019;s there when walking <em>outside<\/em> at <em>night<\/em> with peers is actually possible. That the night sky is beautiful, stars and a moon so bright, extraterrestrial brilliance actually visible rather than blanketed in pollution common in poorer areas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shock is not just the result of the difference between home and Stanford, but it poses a question &#x2014; how do we exist in a space like this, an adaptation so extreme compared to others&#x2019; adjustments, knowing what came before college?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Code-switching, traditionally used by Black people to describe interracial interactions, is a result of this culture shock. It&#x2019;s a <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2019\/11\/the-costs-of-codeswitching\">conscious effort<\/a>, whereas most &#x201C;performances&#x201D; are subconscious, involving the adjustment of one&#x2019;s style of speech, appearance, behavior and expression in ways that will optimize the comfort of others. This is in exchange for fair treatment, quality service and employment opportunities. It&#x2019;s the reason why my language, speech and appearance in Stockton is vastly different at Stanford, not only in the classroom but with peers and some friends as well. (Not even for networking purposes.) That I&#x2019;m only in bliss, only in a state of relaxation and not having to upkeep an image, when I&#x2019;m with others like myself, or at least with those who extend their empathy like an open hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#x2019;s hard, especially when some people at this institution try to close doors rather than keep them open. When peers close their mind to the possibility of others&#x2019; struggles with culture shock. When peers negate and trivialize FLI student&#x2019;s past struggle with the fact that tuition is paid for, or implications that we&#x2019;re spoon-fed and receive handouts. When peers diminish FLI and marginalized students&#x2019; accomplishments, implications of tokenization, diversity points,&nbsp;being &#x201C;saved&#x201D; by affirmative action and the common &#x201C;your SAT score is below average.&#x201D; When peers choose who can label themselves as FLI, implications of owning fashionable clothes, luxury items, AirPods or an iPhone can prevent an individual from claiming the FLI identity. And when this University continues to <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.us1.list-manage.com\/track\/click?u=a6e6e96fbb8fbb96fc6af9c6f&amp;id=8a6f9ea75e&amp;e=4771937a48\">fail<\/a> and not meet the bare <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/08\/04\/student-organizations-rally-to-aid-housing-insecure-stanford-students\/\">minimum<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/04\/30\/low-income-first-gen-students-face-challenges-with-remote-quarter\/\">for<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/04\/26\/same-storm-different-boats-navigating-stanford-while-fli\/\">FLI<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/02\/06\/finding-a-place-at-stanford-frosh-fli-students-journeys\/\">students<\/a> time after time again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#x2019;s an invisible pressure to appeal to hegemonic structures. FLI students live in a pressure cooker. We are constantly and consciously switching between persona, an act that people who are used to this environment don&#x2019;t recognize. It&#x2019;s an adaptation that is severe for FLI and marginalized students, where sometimes we can even lose ourselves and ignore our roots in exchange for acceptance from others. This isn&#x2019;t to say &#x201C;stay in poverty, don&#x2019;t go to elite universities, don&#x2019;t partake in social mobility and never do anything good for yourself,&#x201D; but it poses another complex question to ask for those entering college, those ready to &#x201C;perform&#x201D; at an elite institution and bathe in the benefits of its education &#x2014; what part of ourselves, of our cultures and our background, are lost in trying to exist in a place like Stanford?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Stanford is a social construct.

Recommended by Kirsten Mettler &#x2019;23.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can honestly say I have never read anything like &#x201C;Interior Chinatown.&#x201D; Winner of the 2020 National Book Award, the novel creatively blurs lines between fantasy and reality, all while being completely written in screenplay format. While reading it, there were times I was completely lost, but I didn&#x2019;t really care. The novel was an immersive experience, less about specific plot points, and more about soaking in sentiment and feeling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The book follows Willis Wu, a struggling actor in Hollywood, as he battles Hollywood tropes and &#x201C;Generic Asian Man&#x201D; casting (like &#x201C;Kung Fu Guy&#x201D; or &#x201C;Delivery Guy&#x201D;). His whole family is in the business, and they have all faced the same obstacles of typecasting and racism. The book is honest, entertaining and laugh-out-loud funny, while also being a sharp critique of institutional racism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&#x201C;<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/15811545-a-tale-for-the-time-being\"><strong>A Tale for the Time Being<\/strong><\/a><strong>&#x201D; by Ruth Ozeki. Recommended by Lily Zhou &#x2019;22.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortlisted for the 2013 Man Booker Prize, &#x201C;A Tale for the Time Being&#x201D; is a metafictional novel that centers around Nao Yasutani, a Japanese American teenager who moves with her family from the Silicon Valley to Tokyo, where she finds herself unable to adjust to her new home. She is mercilessly bullied in school, her father struggles with depression and her family runs into financial troubles. A period of time later, Nao&#x2019;s diary is swept onto the shores of an island in British Columbia, where it is discovered by a Japanese American writer named Ruth. Over time, Ruth becomes obsessed with Nao&#x2019;s diary, and resolves to find and save her.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#x2019;ve never seen an author write characters as compassionately as Ruth Ozeki does; Ozeki&#x2019;s prose is unpretentious, sincere and warm-hearted. Although this novel is at times disorienting to read in its traversal through time, distance and perspective, the novel&#x2019;s usage of parallel timelines, by the end of the book, proves to be emotionally cohesive. This book is, at its core, a book about loneliness and the impossible lengths we go to overcome it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&#x201C;<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/54814676-crying-in-h-mart\"><strong>Crying in H Mart<\/strong><\/a><strong>&#x201D; by Michelle Zauner. Recommended by Kyla Figueroa &#x2019;24.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Crying in H Mart&#x201D; is a memoir by alternative pop band Japanese Breakfast&#x2019;s lead singer-songwriter, Michelle Zauner. At a glance, the book is about family, and, more specifically, Zauner&#x2019;s mother, food, grief and endurance. Reflecting on anecdotes from various points throughout her life, from growing up as one of the few Asian Americans in her community to eating food with her mom when visiting her grandmother in Seoul, everything comes to head when Zauner, at 25, receives news that her mom is diagnosed with terminal cancer. After feeling detached from her roots due to moving away from home, she undergoes a forced reckoning of her identity and uses cooking to reclaim parts that she has lost.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The memoir removes the glitz and glam pop-stars tend to have; vulnerability gives Michelle Zauner a genuineness we don&#x2019;t see on magazine covers or on stage. Moreover, while she recounts her specific experience as an Asian American woman and uplifts these voices through her spotlight, her story universally resonates. I think of what my cultural objects are &#x2014; the &#x201C;H Mart&#x201D; in my life &#x2014; and, as I read Zauner&#x2019;s words, reflect on my relationship with my identity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&#x201C;<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/5439.Interpreter_of_Maladies\"><strong>Interpreter of Maladies<\/strong><\/a><strong>&#x201D; by Jhumpa Lahiri. Recommended by Peyton Lee &#x2019;24.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having won literature&#x2019;s two largest accolades &#x2014; a Pulitzer Prize and an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oprah.com\/book\/books-that-defined-a-generation-interpreter-of-maladies?editors_pick_id=57175\">endorsement from Oprah<\/a> &#x2014; &#x201C;Interpreter of Maladies&#x201D; should be considered a modern classic. Personally, I believe Lahiri deserves every ounce of praise she&#x2019;s received. The nine short stories that compose the collection are attached thematically and culturally but distinct in plot. The prose is effortless, concise and beautiful, catering addictiveness to voracious, one-sitting readers and digestibility to casual ones. My favorite stories are actually the first three: &#x201C;A Temporary Matter,&#x201D; &#x201C;When Mr. Pirzada Came to Dine&#x201D; and the titular &#x201C;Interpreter of Maladies.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The collection&#x2019;s mastery shines brightest in its treatment of Indian culture and history. Whether describing living conditions in Kolkata or customary Indian recipes, Lahiri finds a way to show readers another world without alienating them. It is this remarkable display of cultural appreciation &#x2014; balanced with a nuanced commentary on the human condition &#x2014; that makes &#x201C;Interpreter of Maladies&#x201D; so wonderful, and an absolute must-read for anyone who appreciates life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&#x201C;<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/en\/book\/show\/51456746-disability-visibility\"><strong>Disability Visibility<\/strong><\/a><strong>&#x201D; by Alice Wong. Recommended by Richard Coca &#x2019;22.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the introduction for this book, Alice Wong reflects on the lack of representation she saw in books, film, television and media as a &#x201C;disabled person in an ableist society.&#x201D; As Wong grew older, she discovered a community of disabled people and found stories that gave her &#x201C;a sense of what is possible.&#x201D; After writing and having a letter published in <a href=\"https:\/\/disabilityvisibilityproject.com\/book\/dv\/\">Time<\/a> about accessible public transit as an Asian woman with spinal muscular atrophy, she began collecting other stories about disability and developed her voice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Disability Visibility: First-Person Stories from the Twenty-First Century&#x201D; is a must-read anthology of the stories of disabled folk and activists that drives home the point that community is magical, political and critical to survival.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article is a review and contains subjective opinions, thoughts and critiques.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>May is National Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month, during which we honor the history and culture of AAPI communities around the world.

Recommended by Eric Zhu &#x2019;25. Directed by DANIELS. In theaters now.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#x201C;<\/em>Everything Everywhere All at Once&#x201D;<em> <\/em>is a trippy, hilariously self-aware, beautiful multiverse action movie filled to the brim with carefully curated chaos. Behind the film&#x2019;s innovative blending of genres and unorthodox multimedia shots and action sequences is, at its core, the story of an Asian American family. The film begins and ends with Evelyn Wang, a Chinese American laundromat owner and mother to Joy Wang, a lesbian teenager. Through her supernatural journey, Evelyn fights not only evil IRS workers from other dimensions but also her own self-doubt and unwillingness to accept her daughter&#x2019;s identity. The movie tackles controversial and complex themes of Asian American stereotypes in creative and far out ways that immerse the viewer in an absurd, over-the-top multiverse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Evelyn&#x2019;s identity in the main universe presents a relatable narrative of a Chinese working-class immigrant. In this universe, Evelyn&#x2019;s marriage is crumbling and she has to work long hours to put money on the table. The Evelyns in the alternate universes where she goes on to live out her dreams represent the American Dream. In one particular recurring universe, Evelyn goes on to fulfill her dream of becoming a famous singer. Her life here is filled with wealth and success, representing an idealized world in which the idea that anyone can become anything through hard work is realized. The contrast between her glamorized alternate life and her reality tempt her into remaining a different version of herself, which she ultimately rejects due to her love for her daughter.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Everything Everywhere All at Once&#x201D; is an authentic and moving story of the Asian American experience that ventures far outside the bounds of realism. Even with its innovative unorthodoxy and hot-dog-finger dimensions, I felt a personal connection with the movie throughout every moment of its story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&#x201C;<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.showtime.com\/play\/3492185\"><strong>Minari<\/strong><\/a><strong>&#x201D; (2020). Recommended by Kristofer Roland Nino &#x2019;25. Directed by Lee Isaac Chung. Watch on Showtime.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tender, heartbreaking and true to the Korean American experience, &#x201C;Minari&#x201D; is a film that takes its time to paint a small but intimate family portrait that is placed within the wide landscape of the American Dream. Through gorgeous cinematography and poignant performances, the movie explores the life of a Korean American family settling in the rural Ozarks, in search of their own piece of happiness. On their way to that dream, they face setbacks and family tensions &#x2014; and throughout, the story never drags its feet. The plot has a perfect balance of humor, hardship and hope. Each family member&#x2019;s performance carries its own weight &#x2014; the parents, grandmother and children each bring unique brightness to the screen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While &#x201C;Minari&#x201D; is set in the 1980s, it doesn&#x2019;t default to nostalgia, instead paving its own path through the period with clever writing, expertly crafted imagery and raw, honest performances. It&#x2019;s a film that will feel deeply familiar to many Asian Americans and embodies many of the sacrifices and beauties of the immigrant experience. Overall, &#x201C;Minari&#x201D; defies formula by representing Asian Americans, but also by simply focusing on the humanity of its characters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&#x201C;<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.disneyplus.com\/movies\/shang-chi-and-the-legend-of-the-ten-rings\/5GyV9sf9Y041?\"><strong>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings<\/strong><\/a><strong>&#x201D; (2021). Recommended by Kristofer Roland Nino &#x2019;25 . Directed by Destin Daniel Cretton. Watch on Disney Plus.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was about time there was an Asian American superhero! While &#x201C;Shang-Chi&#x201D; breaks ground culturally with its stellar cast comprised of mostly Asians and Asian Americans, it is also a genuinely entertaining watch that manages to have both the spectacle of a typical superhero flick and a surprising amount of heart.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The film follows Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) and his journey to stop Wenwu (Tony Leung), his father and the leader of a crime syndicate called the Ten Rings. Through this adventure, he teams up with his best friend, Katy (Awkwafina) and his sister, Xu Xialing (Meng&#x2019;er Zhang), and uses his martial arts to stop the Ten Rings from unleashing a great evil. &#x201C;Shang-Chi&#x201D; is a fun romp, with excellent humor and impressive martial arts choreography. While the second half of the film does somewhat taper into a typical Marvel, CGI battle, I believe its merits outshine its flaws. Simu Liu gives a stand-out performance as a new superhero, and is complemented well by Awkwafina&#x2019;s comedy. Furthermore, the film&#x2019;s villain, Wenwu, is one of the most compelling in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with heartbreaking motivations for why he is fighting against his son.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&#x201C;<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hulu.com\/movie\/saving-face-fdc0b95e-6235-4fea-adc4-ac1c9764f466?entity_id=fdc0b95e-6235-4fea-adc4-ac1c9764f466\"><strong>Saving Face<\/strong><\/a><strong>&#x201D; (2004). Recommended by Peyton Lee &#x2019;24. Directed by Alice Wu &#x2019;90 M.S. &#x2019;92. Watch on Hulu.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After receiving two computer science degrees from Stanford and working at Microsoft, Alice Wu &#x2019;90 M.S. &#x2019;92<strong> <\/strong>decided &#x2014; naturally &#x2014; to write and direct her very first feature-length film. And how lucky we are that she did. &#x201C;Saving Face&#x201D; is a heartfelt treatise on the Chinese American experience that effectively combines both cultural appreciation and a compelling story. Based loosely on Wu&#x2019;s own experience coming out to her mother, the film follows Wil (Michelle Krusiec) as she navigates her professional, romantic and familial lives. While juggling her career as a surgeon and her relationship with dancer Vivian (Lynn Chen) should be difficult enough, her life is turned upside-down when her mother (Joan Chen) is abruptly disowned by Wil&#x2019;s grandfather for being pregnant out of wedlock.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Critically, Wu infuses discussions of Chinese culture into her narrative. <a href=\"https:\/\/nymag.com\/nymetro\/movies\/features\/11892\/\">Rejecting big studios&#x2019; offers<\/a> in fear of losing her voice, Wu sought to project her personal experience in the Taiwanese American community onto the silver screen. Wil&#x2019;s relationship with her mother and the draconian expectations of the family&#x2019;s social circle are refreshing, evocative portrayals of Chinese social culture. Yet the movie remains accessible: Wu employs romcom conventions &#x2014; including at least one major plot twist &#x2014; but subverts traditional romcom expectations. The mastery of &#x201C;Saving Face&#x201D; lies in the balance and synergy between all these concepts, a truly remarkable achievement that makes it enjoyable for all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&#x201C;<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hulu.com\/series\/your-lie-in-april-8156b6d6-46ae-4576-877e-022657255de6\"><strong>Your Lie in April<\/strong><\/a><strong>&#x201D; (2015). Recommended by Linda Liu &#x2019;25. Directed by Kyohei Ishiguro. Watch on Hulu.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Growing up in an Asian culture, I have always been surrounded by anime-lovers, but I scoffed at the genre. I saw it as detached from reality or containing too many cliches based on the snippets that I had seen from my sister&#x2019;s computer screen. But when my friend introduced me to &#x201C;Your Lie in April&#x201D; over winter break, I felt as if my life was changed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 22-episode anime series traces the growth of the 13-year-old former piano prodigy Kosei Arima, who becomes unable to hear the notes he plays after the death of his mother. Kaori Miyazono, a free-spirited violinist, walks into his world and helps him rediscover his love for music and reshape his understanding of music from being dictated by composers to a free medium through which one can send desired messages to listeners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Your Lie in April&#x201D; is brilliant in its ability to entrance the audience with such a simple and seemingly cliched storyline of a middle-school romance and a musician&#x2019;s personal growth. It is also a feast for the ears, containing masterful renditions of famous classical solo pieces. As a musician who has struggled to find joy in playing music for a year since losing access to ensembles at the start of the pandemic, I was touched by the expression in the music and transformed by the anime&#x2019;s main theme. Regardless of skill level, at the heart of every musician&#x2019;s mission is a devotion to communicating with listeners via harmonies delivered through their unique touch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&#x201C;<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/tubitv.com\/movies\/526922\/kumu-hina?start=true&amp;utm_source=google-feed&amp;tracking=google-feed\"><strong>Kumu Hina<\/strong><\/a><strong>&#x201D; (2014). Recommended by Kirsten Mettler &#x2019;23. Directed by Joe Wilson and Dean Hamer. Watch on Tubi.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I first watched &#x201C;Kumu Hina&#x201D; for &#x201C;Race, Gender and Sexuality in Contemporary American Film,&#x201D; taught by former American Studies Lecturer <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2021\/08\/18\/lecturers-departure-renews-concern-over-lack-of-tenured-asian-american-studies-faculty\/\">William Gow<\/a>. The documentary explores the intersection of colonization and gender by following Hina, a third gender (or &#x201C;m&#x101;h&#x16B;&#x201D;) hula teacher. Hina is as lovable as can be, as she works to mentor Ho&#x2019;onani, a student who wants to join the school&#x2019;s all-male hula group despite their assigned-at-birth identity. We also observe Hina&#x2019;s life as the island continues to be developed for tourism and she struggles in her relationship with a man from Tonga.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Documentaries really sing when they are both educational and compelling. &#x201C;Kumu Hina&#x201D; expertly zooms in and out to educate viewers deeply about Hina&#x2019;s life but also about the larger context of gender conception in Hawaii. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.manoanow.org\/kaleo\/special_issues\/the-m-h\/article_ba191154-0dd9-11e8-ba11-bbb0d1090a78.html\">M&#x101;h&#x16B;<\/a>, or &#x201C;the in-between,&#x201D; are cultural and spiritual leaders who embody male and female spirits. When Western missionaries came to Hawaii, they gave the term &#x201C;m&#x101;h&#x16B;&#x201D; a derogatory connotation and spread binary conceptions of gender identity. Through Hina&#x2019;s experiences, we see the impact that this history has on the everyday lives of people in Hawaii. This learning feels intimate, like a conversation, as Hina gifts viewers with an unfiltered view of her life and her home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&#x201C;<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/tubitv.com\/movies\/302158\/eat-drink-man-woman?start=true&amp;utm_source=google-feed&amp;tracking=google-feed\"><strong>Eat, Drink, Man, Women<\/strong><\/a><strong>&#x201D; (1994). Recommended by Kirsten Mettler &#x2019;23. Directed by Ang Lee. Watch on Tubi.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This film follows famous and aging chef Zhu and his three daughters as the family moves into new stages of their lives. Zhu faces his impending retirement as time deteriorates his senses, and he feels increasingly lonely when his daughters move out and start their independent, adult lives. Set in Taipei, &#x201C;Eat, Drink, Man, Woman&#x201D; is a fresh and moving exploration of love, family and adulthood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#x2019;ve probably watched the movie a half dozen times, but each watch just makes me like it more. The characters are painfully relatable. Zhu is grumpy and withholding, but makes your heart melt as he works to take care of his family friend&#x2019;s daughter, Shan-Shan, in the only way he knows how &#x2014; with food. I personally connect most with Jia-Chien, Zhu&#x2019;s middle child, as she struggles to balance work with family. Every character in this film is so moving and three-dimensional that anyone can find a figment of themselves in &#x201C;Eat, Drink, Man, Women.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&#x201C;<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt10062292\/\"><strong>Never Have I Ever<\/strong><\/a><strong>&#x201D; (2020). Recommended by Kirsten Mettler &#x2019;23. Created by Mindy Kaling and Lang Fisher. Watch on Netflix.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Corny teen romance? I&#x2019;m there. &#x201C;Never Have I Ever&#x201D; is a Netflix Original series following first-generation Indian American teenager Devi as she navigates love, friendship and the death of her father. Devi makes mistake after mistake: choosing love over her friends, going for the popular guy instead of the crush right in front of her and picking fights over the little things. Yet, even as Devi fails time and time again, we are right there with her, remembering the pain of our teenage years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Never Have I Ever&#x201D; is certainly not the best show of all time, and I&#x2019;d say the first season was significantly better than the ones that have followed, but it is a sweet, enjoyable watch, perfect for plowing through in a weekend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article is a review and contains subjective opinions, thoughts and critiques.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>May is National Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage month, honoring the history and culture of AAPI communities around the world.

href=\"https:\/\/gostanford.com\/news\/2022\/5\/28\/mens-basketball-ingram-withdraws-from-nba-draft.aspx\">announced<\/a> that he was withdrawing from the NBA Draft and returning to Stanford for his sophomore season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision comes two months after Ingram became the third Stanford freshman to <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/03\/30\/freshman-forward-harrison-ingram-declares-for-nba-draft\/\">declare<\/a> for the draft in three years. He followed Ziaire Williams &#8217;24, who was picked 10th overall in the 2021 NBA Draft, and Tyrell Terry &#8217;23, who was drafted with the 31st pick in 2020.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In high school, Ingram played for St. Mark&#x2019;s School in Dallas and was a McDonald&#x2019;s All-American. He ended his prep career as the No. 22-ranked player in ESPN&#x2019;s Top 100 and was Stanford&#x2019;s highest recruit in the class of 2025.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the Farm, the 6-foot-7 forward quickly earned a reputation as a versatile scorer and strong defender. In his rookie campaign, he averaged 10.5 points, 6.7 rebounds and 3.0 assists per contest en route to becoming Stanford&#x2019;s first Pac-12 Freshman of the Year since Casey Jacobsen in 2000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the season, Ingram was also named the Pac-12 Freshman of the Week six times &#x2014; the second-most number of times in Pac-12 history &#x2014; and was an All-Pac-12 honorable mention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was this success that led Ingram to declare for the draft, where he was widely projected to be a mid-to-late second-round pick.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, his return marks the latest news in a noteworthy offseason for the Stanford men&#x2019;s basketball team. After a 16-16 overall performance during the 2021-2022 season and an 8-12 Pac-12 record, the Cardinal are set to return six of the team&#x2019;s top seven scorers and eight of the top nine leaders in minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this offseason, sophomore guard Noah Taitz committed to Loyola Marymount University, and senior forward Jaiden Delaire declared that he would transfer to the University of San Diego for his final college season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ingram&#x2019;s return coincides with the additions of incoming freshmen Ryan Agrawal from Coppell, Texas and Jaylen Thompson from Oakland, Calif. The team will also welcome its first transfer player since 2009, graduate student guard Michael Jones from Davidson College.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These newcomers and Ingram will undoubtedly help the Cardinal compete in the ultra-competitive Pac-12 next season. Last season, the Arizona Wildcats swept the conference&#x2019;s regular season and tournament titles, while Stanford finished in ninth.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On Saturday, freshman forward Harrison Ingram announced that he was withdrawing from the NBA Draft and returning to Stanford for his sophomore year.

Students who wish to <a href=\"https:\/\/rde.stanford.edu\/studenthousing\/early-or-late-move-outs\">stay<\/a> past their move-out date should contact the <a href=\"https:\/\/rde.stanford.edu\/studenthousing\/housing-service-centers\">Housing Service Center<\/a>, and they will be charged additional rent for each day they stay.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students who get COVID-19 and isolate in place or in university-provided isolation housing need to plan to move out on time because individuals living on campus over the summer, including students participating in Summer Session, summer visitors and new students, will be moving into residences that students are vacating, according to Hicks and Everett.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students isolating in place may be moved to other isolation housing if their unit or building is needed immediately for incoming residents, they added. Students will still receive food through the University&#x2019;s meal delivery service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To prepare for move-out, Hicks and Everett wrote that students should start packing everything except &#x201C;a 10-day supply of clothing, items you need to complete your school work, medication and valuables&#x201D; that they can bring with them to isolation if they get COVID-19. They added that students should ask a friend or family member to be prepared to pack and move for them if they are not able to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students who test positive and need someone else to pack their belongings should fill out the Room Key Proxy <a href=\"https:\/\/rdeapp.stanford.edu\/StudentPortal\/KeyProxy\">form<\/a> to provide a Stanford friend access to their residence. If a student makes a plan with a family member or non-Stanford friend, then they should contact <a href=\"https:\/\/rde.stanford.edu\/studenthousing\/housing-service-centers\">their housing service center<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hicks and Everett reminded students that people who are testing positive for COVID-19 are experiencing a range of symptoms, from no or mild symptoms to symptoms related to a bad cold or flu. They asked that students continue to wear masks indoors and in crowded outdoor settings to limit the number of students who test positive ahead of move-out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;A bit of preparation now could go a long way toward helping you through this time, and on to a summer that we all hope is a welcome respite from the challenges of the past few years,&#x201D; they wrote.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Housing contracts for undergraduate students leaving Stanford for the summer or moving to a different residence expire. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1002916,"featured_media":1205359,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1485,3,4424],"tags":[4052,66572,60163,78100,61444,8735,15012,35626],"site-layouts":[],"coauthors":[71809],"parsely":{"version":"1.1.0","meta":{"@context":"https:\/\/schema.org","@type":"NewsArticle","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/05\/29\/move-out-is-approaching-here-is-what-you-should-do-if-you-test-positive-for-covid-19\/"},"headline":"Move-out is approaching.

Their identities, while known by The Daily, are being withheld in this article because of fear of academic retaliation.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students are boycotting <a href=\"https:\/\/explorecourses.stanford.edu\/search?view=catalog&amp;filter-coursestatus-Active=on&amp;page=0&amp;catalog=&amp;academicYear=20212022&amp;q=COMPLIT+123%3A+The+Novel+and+the+World&amp;collapse=\">COMPLIT 123: &#8220;The Novel and The World&#8221;<\/a> following an incident which several students perceived as discriminatory towards an Asian student. Students say they see this incident as a reflection of a broader lack of diversity among faculty and teaching staff within the Comparative Literature department.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multiple students in the course criticized one of the instructors, Joan Ramon Resina, for dismissing student perspectives on orientalism in a course text called &#x201C;The Mandarin,&#x201D; written by E&#xE7;a de Queir&#xF3;s, a 19th century Portuguese author.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Resina and his co-instructor, lecturer Nathan Wainstein, did not respond to a request for comment on student criticism of Resina&#x2019;s behavior.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;The Mandarin&#x201D; follows Teodoro, an impoverished Portuguese civil servant in Lisbon. Teodoro accepts the Devil&#x2019;s offer to inherit unlimited riches by killing a rich Chinese official. Later regretting his decision, Teodoro travels to China in an effort to find the family of the man he killed. The text includes descriptions of Chinese individuals and the country. While students were critical of the text&#x2019;s representation of China, they came to class on Monday of Week 6 ready to engage critically with the text despite its orientalist elements, according to Emily, a student and comparative literature major who is in the class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Rather than fostering an open discussion, Prof. Resina created an atmosphere of hostility by repeatedly asserting that we should abstract away from the racial element of the book,&#x201D; Emily said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a student presentation on orientalism in the novella, students said the text was revisited towards the end of the class when Resina introduced an argument that the moral issue of killing Chinese official is a universal one.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taylor, an Asian student in the class, attempted to speak about the racial and colonialist dynamics in the novella. She said she hoped to express that the discussion of morality applies differently to colonizers and colonized people, because of unequal power dynamics between the two groups. However, according to Taylor and other students in the class, Resina repeatedly insisted on changing the topic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t even get to finish my sentence before I was just abruptly interrupted by the professor,&#x201D; Taylor said. &#x201C;I felt very emotionally distraught, but after his two-minute speech, I still managed to raise my hand and finish my initial thought, to which he responded with dismissal,&#x201D; she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon leaving the class and being asked by a classmate if she was okay, Taylor broke down in tears. Seven other students from the class gathered around her to provide comfort and express their own condemnation of Resina&#x2019;s behavior as Resina and Wainstein exited the building without stopping.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Taylor, Resina did not make any visible effort to recognize that he made students feel uncomfortable in the class.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;He didn&#x2019;t apologize, didn&#x2019;t acknowledge his mistake,&#x201D; Taylor said. &#x201C;For me, that&#x2019;s ample ground to assume that he might continue doing similar things in the future.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The incidents, and lack of follow-up from Resina, led a few students to boycott the next class meeting. Only four students out of 10 attended the class. Four of the students who chose not to come explicitly cited the boycott as their reason for skipping class.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the boycott, students drafted a letter provided to The Daily to the Chair of the Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages (DLCL), which includes the Comparative Literature department. In the letter, students described the text as &#x201C;shot through a Western colonial lens&#x201D; and &#x201C;dehumanizing&#x201D; in its depictions of Chinese people. &#x201C;The Mandarin&#x201D; was the only text in the course syllabus focusing on a region in Asia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the letter, students characterized Resina&#x2019;s interruptions and responses as &#x201C;rebuking [Taylor&#x2019;s] point&#x201D; and &#x201C;clearly dismissive.&#x201D; According to the letter, Taylor perceived her professor&#x2019;s response to her as &#x201C;an instance of racism and sexism,&#x201D; especially since Resina had previously mistaken her for another Asian student in a zoom session.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Included in the letter was a description of the class meeting following the incident from a student in attendance. Based on their account, Resina expressed his right to get the class &#x201C;back on the rails&#x201D; and described the students&#x2019; perspectives on the text as &#8220;identity politics.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students also proposed three options for &#x201C;improving the situation and mitigating further harm&#x201D; in COMPLIT 123 in their letter. Continuing the class with Wainstein as their sole instructor was their preferred option. The other two proposed options were to allow students to withdraw from the class without penalty, or to independently study with Wainstein, the preferred instructor among students interviewed by The Daily. Eight of the 10 students in the class signed the letter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to the letter, the DLCL provided students with four different options to move forward with the class. In option one, students could choose to attend class and complete assignments as before. Students could also decide to submit work without going to class. Alternatively, students could choose not to do any more work for the class and switch their grading basis to CR\/NC, while still fulfilling a major requirement. The last proposed option was to withdraw &#x2014; and receive a &#x2018;W&#x2019; on their transcript &#x2014; from the class by the Week 8 deadline, May 20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Resina and Wainstein did not respond to a request for comment regarding the options presented to students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several students were disheartened by the fact that their preferred option &#x2014; to continue attending COMPLIT 123 without interacting with Resina &#x2014; was not included.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;We as students are deprived of the opportunity of going to class if we do not want to see him again,&#x201D; a student in the class named River said. &#x201C;We take the class not just for the requirement, but because we want to learn.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some students opted to either change their grading basis to CR\/NC or continue to complete work without attending class. As multiple students told The Daily, they had no desire to communicate with Resina after the incident.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want to interact with this professor,&#x201D; Mike, a student in the class, said. &#x201C;This professor is a tenured professor, but I don&#x2019;t believe in anything he believes in.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several students in the class linked this event and the DLCL&#x2019;s response to larger departmental problems. For example, Emily described a fundamental mismatch between the demographic diversity of students majoring and minoring in the field, and the faculty working in the DLCL and in turn, their curriculum.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&#x201C;As students, we want this incident to be an impetus for hiring more diverse faculty within the DLCL,&#x201D; Emily said.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DLCL Chair Cecil Alduy wrote in a statement to The Daily that &#x201C;diversity and inclusiveness are at the core of the DLCL &#x2014; they are our very identity and purpose, as we devote ourselves to the study, teaching and spreading of non-Anglophone cultures and literatures from the five continents.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alduy cited the department&#x2019;s faculty, who come from more than 16 different countries, and the language program, which offers more than 40 languages, as indicative of a commitment to diversity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alduy acknowledged that the department is working towards diversifying its faculty. &#x201C;We have been striving over the past years to hire yet more diverse professors; we are not yet where we would like to be on this but we continue to work on it.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for several students in COMPLIT 123, the DLCL is not living up to its mission. According to Taylor, for example, pursuing the institutional route to addressing the harm caused by this incident has led to a &#x201C;dead end.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;It makes me really sad that professors don&#x2019;t know how to teach things that they don&#x2019;t necessarily have expertise in. And it happens to be that [in] the COMPLIT department &#8230; you know, almost all the professors have exclusively their expertise in European literature and novels, with a few exceptions,&#x201D; Taylor said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In sharing the story of this incident, Taylor and other students hope to &#x201C;leverage the momentum that COMPLIT 123 has fostered in response to the incident in class to help future generations of COMPLIT students.&#x201D;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p> Following an incident which several students perceived as discriminatory towards an Asian

of Madness\u2019 review: A powerful allegory of the time I smoked weed before watching \u2018Doctor Strange\u2019"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>When I finished watching &#x201C;Multiverse of Madness,&#x201D; I was very confused about what it wanted me to take away. Was it a commentary on the COVID-19 pandemic? A commentary on political polarization? Or was it a commentary on half-delirious journalists hastily connecting the film to broader social events? But after some careful analysis, I&#x2019;ve realized that &#x201C;Multiverse of Madness&#x201D; is a clear allegory to the time I smoked weed before watching &#x201C;Doctor Strange&#x201D; back in 2016. For any Marvel fans who somehow haven&#x2019;t seen &#x201C;Multiverse of Madness&#x201D; yet, expect to meditate thoughtfully with director Sam Raimi on the time I smoked weed before watching &#x201C;Doctor Strange,&#x201D; as well as the dangers of doing it again before watching &#x201C;Multiverse of Madness.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I arrived at the theater, I was about an hour late for the movie, and about three weeks late for when my &#x201C;Multiverse of Madness&#x201D; review was supposed to be published. This was clearly a metaphor of the time in 2016 when I was supposed to review &#x201C;Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip&#x201D; for Nickelodeon.com but accidentally downed a shit ton of edibles and entered the &#x201C;Doctor Strange&#x201D;<em> <\/em>theater instead. &#x201C;Multiverse of Madness&#x201D; has a sadistic pleasure in confusing its viewers. This helps suspend their disbelief that they were as confused as me in 2016, who didn&#x2019;t realize that I wasn&#x2019;t watching a bunch of CGI chipmunks until the end credits. Bravo Sam Raimi!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In times of unprecedented changes, &#x201C;Multiverse of Madness&#x201D; allows viewers to relive the good old days when they didn&#x2019;t have to worry about losing their job at Nickelodeon for &#x201C;reckless cannabis use&#x201D; and &#x201C;child endangerment.&#x201D; But it also warns viewers not to view the past with such uncritical nostalgia. Whoever designed the theater for &#x201C;Multiverse of Madness&#x201D; perfectly recreated the kid who would not stop playing &#x201C;Subway Surfers&#x201D; at full volume while I was trying to watch &#x201C;Doctor Strange.&#x201D; But &#x201C;Multiverse of Madness&#x201D; takes some artistic risks: instead of the kid playing &#x201C;Subway Surfers&#x201D; throughout the whole movie, it was me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, some fans may accuse &#x201C;Multiverse of Madness&#x201D; of pandering. Early in the second act, if a viewer briefly pauses their &#x201C;Subway Surfers&#x201D; game to pay attention to the movie, they will hear Benedict Cumberbatch say something about dreams. Cumberbatch is clearly trying to pander to the viewer&#x2019;s daily dreams of Cumberbatch throughout high school: imagining his PG-13 body against theirs, promising to give the viewer whatever fanservice they desire. Needless to say, this is one of the worst performances by Cumberbatch, and a blatant attempt to pander to the demographic of lonely high schoolers who would hide in the bathroom every lunch period to watch &#x201C;Sherlock. <em>How do you do, fellow kids?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But only my interpretation of &#x201C;Multiverse of Madness&#x201D; is valid, and anyone who disagrees is lying to me. For this reason I have to give &#x201C;Multiverse of Madness&#x201D; five Spongebobs out of five, which is the exact score I gave for &#x201C;Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip&#x201D; before my wife left me. See my other reviews for &#x201C;Spider-Man: No Way Home&#x201D; and &#x201C;Hawkeye,&#x201D; where I complain anytime an MCU movie does not perfectly recreate the time I watched &#x201C;Doctor Strange&#x201D;<em> <\/em>in 2016, which was honestly the last time I actually enjoyed a Marvel movie.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article is purely satirical and fictitious.

Brewer\u2019s \u2018The Red Arrow\u2019 is a complex portrait of a struggling writer"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p><em>Content warning: this article contains reference to suicide. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#x2019;s rare for me to come across a character in a novel that I find as infuriating as I do worthy of sympathy. Yet in his debut novel, &#x201C;The Red Arrow,&#x201D; William Brewer manages to create such a complex and layered character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The novel follows an unnamed writer struggling with depression and writer&#x2019;s block who, in a bid to get out of debt from his publisher, agrees to ghostwrite a memoir for an unnamed famous physicist (referred to in-novel as simply &#x201C;The Physicist&#x201D;). When The Physicist suddenly disappears, the narrator travels to Italy to search for him. This novel is told through a nonlinear narrative &#x2014; the bulk of which takes place on a train ride through Italy &#x2014; as the narrator ruminates on all of the decisions that have led to his current predicament.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The narrator of &#x201C;The Red Arrow&#x201D; is, in a word, obnoxious. He is, at all times, painfully aware of the reader&#x2019;s scrutiny and frequently engages in self-censorship; at multiple points in the novel, he displays anxiety over the reader&#x2019;s judgment of him. The narration is often marked by long stretches of dialogue ruminating on literature, design or physics. Much of the narrator&#x2019;s internal monologue is preoccupied with quotations and passages from other books that he consumes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To these books, the narrator has two types of reactions (which often occur simultaneously): he despairs at his own lack of writerly talent and drive, and becomes obsessed with these books and their writers. This narrator is the type of person who cares deeply about art and is unafraid to cast sharp judgments about it. In one of the opening scenes of the novel, he and his wife scoff at a stranger wearing a Boy Scout uniform paired with jean shorts, declaring it &#x201C;an aesthetic crime.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the books he reads, the narrator tries and fails to make sense of those around him. He examines his estranged relationship with his father with a scrutiny that borders on cruelty. After sustaining a major injury that prevented him from working, the narrator&#x2019;s father became socially isolated, bitter and ill-tempered. However, the narrator instead chooses to view this behavior as a deficit in character; he characterizes his father as someone who is overly dependent upon interaction. Taking inspiration from The Physicist&#x2019;s work, he claims that his father is like an electron, &#x201C;concrete only in relation to the other physical objects it is interacting with.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, I have the impression that the narrator is truly incapable of seeing the people around him in any other way. The narrator is the type of person who lives through literature, yet fails to understand the life that he has really lived. In his own writing, the narrator retraces his own childhood and adolescence. The narrator&#x2019;s debut collection of short stories, &#x201C;The Troops,&#x201D; is based on his experience as a child in the Boy Scouts. His failed first novel was inspired by his memories of a major oil spill in West Virginia. It is then inevitable that when he undertakes a ghostwriting project for The Physicist, he can&#x2019;t help but go through an identity crisis: he struggles to differentiate between The Physicist&#x2019;s memories and his own.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the narrator&#x2019;s preoccupation with literature, Brewer successfully creates a character whose internal struggles are complex and nuanced. This obsession with books is, ultimately, a front for the narrator&#x2019;s depression. In an otherwise lighthearted passage detailing his early romance with his wife and his early successes, the narrator recalls receiving an important phone call from a writing fellowship &#x201C;just as [he] was leaving to go kill [himself].&#x201D; Despite the narrator&#x2019;s predilection for examining his past for stories, nowhere in the book is there a backstory or clear explanation for his depression. It simply exists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, the narrator&#x2019;s troubles &#x2014; internal and external &#x2014; are resolved in an ending that seems almost magical in its abruptness. In Italy, he succeeds in meeting The Physicist in person. He also succeeds in driving away his depression after undergoing a psychedelic treatment that allows him to see his past in greater clarity. In another book, an ending like this may come off as undeserved. However, I found the narrative arc of &#x201C;The Red Arrow&#x201D; strangely cohesive. It&#x2019;s as if the narrator&#x2019;s act of recounting his past is equivalent to the psychedelic treatment that he underwent &#x2014; that is, the very nature of storytelling catapults him into the process of healing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;The Red Arrow&#x201D; is a book that is preoccupied with books; it centers around a narrator who, through literature, simultaneously loses his sense of self and rediscovers himself anew. Brewer excels at crafting this portrait of an obsessive, pretentious and struggling writer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article is a review and includes subjective thoughts, opinions

from Music beat writers on their favorite artists belonging to the AAPI community who are creating a mark in AAPI representation and art expression.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Zauner (Japanese Breakfast) &#x2014; <\/strong>Kyla Figueroa &#x2019;24<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#x2019;s a rarity for a Grammy-nominated artist to be a New York Times bestselling author. Michelle Zauner, the lead singer and songwriter for the stellar alternative pop band Japanese Breakfast, is also the author of the phenomenal &#x201C;Crying in H-Mart.&#x201D; Zauner&#x2019;s renowned memoir discusses the death of her mother, how she came of age as an Asian American and how she connects with her roots by cooking Korean. My two favorite albums from the band include &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/1uD1kdwTWH1DZQZqGKz6rY?si=29Ts7AvGS06IAGOiF-l2iw\">Jubilee<\/a>&#x201D; &#x2014; its recent record with hits like &#x201C;Be Sweet,&#x201D; &#x201C;Paprika&#x201D; and my personal favorite, &#x201C;Savage Good Boy,&#x201D; &#x2014; and the 2016 record &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/3CeBfyjSIfbWyf0RTNbq1G?si=33af7abb33d04033\">Psychopomp<\/a>,&#x201D; which, again, discusses Zauner&#x2019;s mom&#x2019;s death and her relationship with her identity. Zauner&#x2019;s music is not only a necessity for May but for all months of the year, especially for summer playlists, thanks to the band&#x2019;s groovy yet heartfelt tunes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Oliva Rodrigo &#x2014; <\/strong>Kyla Figueroa &#x2019;24<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With her 2021 breakout hit &#x201C;Driver&#x2019;s License&#x201D; and award-winning album &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/6s84u2TUpR3wdUv4NgKA2j?si=8fcb7120ae924902\">Sour<\/a>,&#x201D; Olivia Rodrigo is a star for Generation Z (Gen Z) and at the top of contemporary young artists. Her interview with &#x201C;Saturday Night Live&#x201D; star Bowen Yang for <a href=\"https:\/\/vmagazine.com\/article\/v132-its-olivia-rodrigos-world\/\">V magazine<\/a> details representation, her experiences being a role model for Asian girls and combating the image of all pop stars being white. Her music, while traditional mainstream pop, contains rock and Y2K influences, including from her idol Avril Lavigne and the band Paramore. My top three songs from the album are &#x201C;traitor,&#x201D; &#x201C;jealousy, jealousy&#x201D; and &#x201C;happier.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conan Gray &#x2014; <\/strong>Kyla Figueroa &#x2019;24<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally known for his work as a YouTuber, Conan Gray has risen to stardom with his TikTok famous song &#x201C;Heather&#x201D; and hit 2020 album &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/2CMlkzFI2oDAy5MbyV7OV5?si=7bc8f9af45b44d80\">Kid Krow<\/a>.&#x201D; Active on various social media platforms, Gray is in tune with current pop culture. His music covers a variety of key themes that resonate with Gen Z, including coming of age, love, loss, finding a place in the world and making space for yourself and others. Gray&#x2019;s lyricism is phenomenal: while the subjects of his works are common, the songs themselves are phonetically pleasing, often using alliteration and internal rhyme. His next album &#x201C;Superache,&#x201D; from which he has already released 7 singles, is out this summer and will be perfect to accompany any occasional blues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anderson .Paak &#x2014; <\/strong>Nick Sligh &#x2019;23<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Silk Sonic has finally brought Anderson .Paak the mainstream love and attention that he has always deserved. The best-selling duo of Anderson .Paak and Bruno Mars has placed .Paak fully in the limelight; however, he has been making incredible music of his own for nearly a decade now. 2016&#x2019;s &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/4VFG1DOuTeDMBjBLZT7hCK?si=TI9pVn8lQoiU64e8R7Gd6A\">Malibu<\/a>&#x201D; &#x2014; one of the best contemporary R&amp;B albums I have heard &#x2014; features a nearly flawless tracklist and is a true modern classic of a compilation. Anderson .Paak has any talent that you could ever want from an artist. The singer, rapper, producer and multi-instrumentalist has brought wonderful contributions to R&amp;B, pop, hip-hop and to the world of music as a whole. He is a truly special figure, and one that any fan of music should be thoroughly acquainted with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chad Hugo &#x2014; <\/strong>Nick Sligh &#x2019;23<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One half of The Neptunes &#x2014; one of the most famous production duos of all time &#x2014; Chad Hugo has been one of the most impactful figures in modern music production. Despite being Pharrell Williams&#x2019; closest collaborator and production partner, Hugo has never reached the same level of mass recognition and acclaim, although his talent warrants it. Following their duo&#x2019;s inception in Virginia Beach, Virginia in 1990, The Neptunes began to shift the sound of the music industry and never looked back. Hugo has produced songs for Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, Britney Spears, Nelly, Ludacris and Usher, among many others. Few producers have ever had as broad and deep of an impact on the sound of pop music as Chad Hugo has had.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NIKI &#x2014; <\/strong>Peyton Lee &#x2019;24<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though she&#x2019;s just 23, Nicole Zefanya (known mononymously as NIKI) has become one of the most prominent Asian American pop musicians in recent years. Extremely precise, silky smooth vocals and homegrown, singer-songwriter emotionality characterize most of her music. Originally from Indonesia, NIKI got her first big break <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AmCsbDqzuUA\">opening for Taylor Swift<\/a>. Soon after cultivating a popular <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/NIKIZFNY\/videos\">YouTube channel<\/a>, she&#x2019;s now one of 88rising&#x2019;s most recognized artists, alongside stars like Joji, Keshi and Rich Brian. With dozens of singles, two EPs, a studio album and a feature on the soundtrack of Marvel&#x2019;s &#x201C;Shang-Chi,&#x201D; NIKI&#x2019;s prolificity is only bound to increase with time. Check out her live sessions and acoustic remixes!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>IZ &#x2014; <\/strong>Peyton Lee &#x2019;24<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You probably know Israel Kamakawiwo&#x2019;ole&#x2019;s (nicknamed Brudda Iz, or just IZ) cover of &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=V1bFr2SWP1I\">Somewhere Over the Rainbow<\/a>,&#x201D; even if you&#x2019;re not familiar with the artist. What you might not know is that IZ was a monumental advocate for Hawaiian independence. Along with several studio albums released with the Makaha Sons of Ni&#x2019;ihau, IZ&#x2019;s inspirational solo discography quickly cemented him as a Hawaiian cultural icon. &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/0pquf1NcG9FdiypBPwICu9?si=85wNFKp5SBGfMCZFHGUCqQ\">Facing Future<\/a>&#x201D; is the best-selling album of all time by a Hawaiian artist. And in 2014, his story &#x2014; including his premature death in 1997 &#x2014; inspired the Disney-Pixar animated short &#x201C;Lava.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>UMI &#8211; <\/strong>Ryan Loo &#x2019;25<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tierra Umi Wilson (known widely by her stage name UMI) is a 23-year-old African American and Japanese indie R&amp;B singer and songwriter native to Seattle. Within her music, UMI often draws inspiration from her multiracial background as a member of both the AAPI community as well as the African diaspora. The majority of the lyrics in her song &#x201C;Sukidakara,&#x201D; from her EP &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/11SCAGedBEKgapd6mCZNZ5\">Love Language<\/a>,&#x201D;&nbsp; are sung in Japanese, seamlessly fusing the historically Black genre of soul and R&amp;B with her Asian identity. As a mixed race African American and Chinese person myself, I appreciate the &#x201C;Blasian&#x201D; representation UMI brings to the indie genre.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, UMI&#x2019;s allure is much deeper than mere representation. Through her gently rhythmic lullaby-like vocals and lofi-inspired beats, UMI&#x2019;s music truly lives up to her stage name, which translates to &#x201C;sea&#x201D; in Japanese. Each line she utters is a wave of relaxation, offering a much needed respite in this often chaotic world, slowly lulling her audience into a state of serenity where they can &#x2013;&#x2013; if even just for a second &#x2013;&#x2013; be at peace with themselves and the world around them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deb Never<\/strong><strong> &#8211; <\/strong>Richard Coca<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I first saw Deb Never perform live, I was told that night was her birthday. I would later find out that was a lie. With different claims of when her birthday was on the internet, it seemed that no one knew when her birthday was. When the question of age arose, it also turned out that no one knew exactly how old she was &#x2014; just that she was in her 20s. This aura of mystery that surrounds Deb Never is intentional, according to the artist herself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Never strives to defy everything around her image, from gender to genre. As a queer Asian in the music industry, Never navigates a very male-dominated space in an incredibly unapologetic manner. As she sings in her latest single, &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/track\/4MdxHfa5fmIdvPwYXM56gS?si=244a04d7b62d44dd\">Crutches<\/a>,&#x201D; &#x201C;[she&#x2019;s] storming in like thunder \/ &#8216;Cause [she&#x2019;s] tired of waiting for \/ Better days, better days.&#x201D; Never is sure to rise in the scene as she continues to find her place in the industry with more music poised to be released soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mitski &#8211; <\/strong>Chloe Walsh &#x2019;25<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mitski is perhaps one of the most enigmatic artists to emerge from the previous decade. Her privacy regarding her personal life has in no way deterred her fanbase&#x2019;s obsession over her, even if the occasional audience yell of &#x201C;I love you&#x201D; has led to her respond with &#x201C;you don&#x2019;t know me.&#x201D; While her debut album, &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/3Y2DBOg3GKXDlsUvh4htsi?si=109142136dd24a4e\">Lush<\/a>,&#x201D; recorded while she was a university student, put her voice on the map, it was her 2018 album &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/42cH7mrkfljkqkxA2Ip9Xq?si=5c8a2be66d5f4f24\">Be The Cowboy<\/a>&#x201D; that established Mitski as a singer with something to say. Pulling on influences from indie pop to classic rock, Mitski has spent the past decade writing about everything from patriarchal gender roles to cultural alienation, and even went viral on TikTok with &#x201C;Washing Machine Heart.&#x201D; If you&#x2019;re looking to explore her discography, I would suggest starting with &#x201C;Me and My Husband&#x201D; and &#x201C;Brand New City.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article is a review and includes subjective opinions, thoughts and critiques.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In

You&#8217;re 250 feet above Stanford&#8217;s campus"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Near the end of my freshman fall quarter, I created my <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2021\/12\/02\/the-four-year-plan-stanford-bucket-list-edition\/\">Stanford bucket list<\/a>, or a list of everything I hoped to explore, accomplish and experience before I graduate. While I was creating this list, I did not expect to successfully complete my frosh year plan, let alone items for later years. On May 20, two of my friends and I spontaneously decided to visit Hoover Tower, securing a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hoover.org\/library-archives\/visit\">reservation<\/a> for the observation deck. Although this was not originally on my list, it was a memorable experience to close frosh year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Standing boldly at approximately 285 feet, Hoover Tower is the iconic tower featured in virtually every Stanford advertisement I saw throughout my childhood. It was surreal being escorted by a friendly staff member up to Floor 14: the observation deck. While we were in the elevator, we spoke with the staff member about how we have been looking forward to going up the tower and seeing the view since New Student Orientation (NSO).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we arrived, the elevator doors swept to the side and our eyes were met with the refreshing sight of Stanford&#x2019;s campus, only with a twist of perspective. For me, my typical 5-foot-high point of view was now replaced with a far bigger picture. I could see all the way from Governor&#x2019;s Corner to Escondido Village Graduate Residences. It was our first time seeing the rooftops of various buildings, among other exciting areas like the entire Stanford Dish trail (plus the Dish itself), our dorm (Larkin love!), the entirety of Main Quad and even the bay in the far distance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we admired the beautiful view, I asked my friends to reflect on their reactions to visiting the observation deck for the first time. I took the time to reflect a bit, too. Here&#x2019;s what we had to say:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giannka Picache &#x2018;25 got metaphorical and nostalgic in her reflection &#x2014;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Besides being a one-of-a-kind experience, standing atop the tallest building on campus while nearing the end of our freshman year kinda reminded me of the phrase I always say: &#x2018;benefit of hindsight.&#x2019; At the start of the year, us tiny [frosh] were sprawling and walking with no hugely definitive path ahead, sort of like the bustling crowd of people below the building, unknowing of the people watching from above and afar. In some ways, I&#x2018;d like to think I started the year as someone on the ground, without much &#x201C;height&#x201D; (i.e. experience) to know what the path ahead looked like. But now as a rising sophomore and an observer standing atop Hoover Tower, I can observe my past self who was once unclear of the path ahead. Now I realize how excited I am to pursue even greater heights!&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lindsey Holiday &#x2018;25 shared her reflection in the style of a bite-sized TripAdvisor review &#x2014;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Hoover Tower is open! Any Stanford student can take up to three people up to the observation deck. I went with some friends last week and it was awesome! Shoutout to Vivian for planning it out. Staff members are super friendly. Definitely recommend it!&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found myself reflecting on what I observed about campus, standing 250 feet above ground level &#x2014;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;In January 2022, I spontaneously decided to become a campus tour guide at Stanford. I thought that it was something I&#x2019;d save for senior year, but I did not want to miss out on this exciting opportunity, especially since it&#x2019;s been something I&#x2019;ve wanted to do. After a few months of the application process, I was pleasantly surprised to be rolled out by the veteran tour guides. Since starting the job, I now view campus from a different lens. I&#x2019;m supposed to know our campus like the back of my hand, yet, when standing here in the tallest building on campus, campus once again surprises me because of its size. I see a group of girls biking together, most likely heading to class. I see a young child playing on the grass with their mom and dad, most likely locals who want to enjoy the sunny Palo Alto weather on this Friday afternoon. I see a girl squinting at her laptop in frustration, most likely working on the CS 107 assignment that is due at 11:59 p.m. (A little too relatable.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I continue to observe the liveliness of campus this afternoon, I cannot help but think about how campus is gradually regaining its hustle and bustle that it lost due to the pandemic. I also reflect on how much personal growth I&#x2019;ve experienced over the past year &#x2014; my friends that I&#x2019;m currently standing next to were not in my life one year ago, yet they are now some of the closest in my life.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we near the end of the school year, I&#x2019;m optimistic that Stanford will continue to maintain its liveliness as more buildings open and more social events occur. Visiting Hoover Tower was a full circle moment for me, especially as I wrap up my freshman year at Stanford. I still remember how my friend, Aya Aziz &#x2018;25, referred to Hoover Tower as her North Star during NSO. I remember feeling lost and alone during NSO, thinking that Wilbur Dining was next to Main Quad because I was too afraid to pull out Google Maps and be revealed as a frosh. I remember thinking that I wasn&#x2019;t fit for computer science because it felt as if my peers learned to code before they learned to walk.

water in Sarasota, Fla. at the NCAA championships. The Cardinal had a strong showing in the qualifying heats and semifinals but just missed out on the title, finishing as the runner-up for the second year <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2021\/06\/01\/womens-rowing-secures-second-at-ncaa-championships\/\">in a row<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stanford earned 124 points in the team category to tie with No. 1 University of Texas. Though the teams scored the same number of points, the Longhorns edged out the Cardinal to take their <a href=\"https:\/\/texassports.com\/news\/2022\/5\/29\/rowing-wins-2022-national-championship.aspx\">second consecutive<\/a> NCAA championship title via a tiebreak by winning the first varsity eights.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first two days of competition could not have gone better for Stanford. In pursuit of their first NCAA title since 2009, the Cardinal glided through every qualifying heat on Day 1 and each semifinal on Day 2. Going into the grand finals for each event on Sunday, Stanford was the only team remaining in the competition that had won every single race it had entered thus far.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We&#39;re the only team remaining at the Division 1 NCAA Women&#39;s Rowing Championships that has won all of its races in Sarasota &#x1F4AA;<br><br>All in preparation for our ultimate goal of bringing home titles tomorrow.<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/GoStanford?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GoStanford<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/GubNItZUjG\">pic.twitter.com\/GubNItZUjG<\/a><\/p>&mdash; Stanford Women&#x2019;s Rowing (@StanfordRowing) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/StanfordRowing\/status\/1530614538906771462?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 28, 2022<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sunday&#x2019;s grand finals began bright and early with the varsity fours. No. 5 Princeton took the title in a tight race. With senior coxswain and Pac-12 Women&#x2019;s Rowing Scholar-Athlete of the Year <a href=\"https:\/\/gostanford.com\/news\/2022\/5\/15\/womens-rowing-pofcher-named-scholar-athlete-of-the-year.aspx\">Nicole Pofcher<\/a> calling the shots in a boat with sophomore Mathilda&nbsp;Kitzmann, sophomore Kieran&nbsp;Wallace, freshman Fiona&nbsp;Mooney and senior Kelsey&nbsp;McGinley, the Cardinal finished just over three seconds off the lead to take fourth overall. The boat&#x2019;s time of 7:08.541 was less than one second behind the third place finisher and eventual overall team champion, Texas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second varsity eights were up next. In another close race, the Cardinal boat with coxswain Rachel Miller, freshman Paloma&nbsp;Sequeira, sophomore Julia&nbsp;Braz, sophomore Beckie&nbsp;Leigh, freshman Luise&nbsp;Bachmann, senior Sophie&nbsp;Dixon, freshman Lucy&nbsp;Burrell, junior Brie Perry and freshman Julietta&nbsp;Camahort hung on for a second place finish in 6:23.220, two seconds behind event winner No. 4 Yale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going into the last grand final, Stanford held a three-point lead with 61 points to Texas&#x2019; 58. Just like at the Pac-12 championship two weeks ago, the title would be decided by a single race. And once again, that race would be the first varsity eights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pressure could not have been higher as the Cardinal&#x2019;s first varsity eight of senior coxswain Caroline Ricksen, senior Azja Czajkowski, sophomore Belle Battistoni, freshman Iris Klok, senior Esther Briz Zamorano, fifth year Kaitlyn Kynast, sophomore Taylor English, sophomore Lettie Cabot and junior Katelin Gildersleeve lined up for the championship regatta&#x2019;s last event. Texas&#x2019; varsity eight entered the race not having lost in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncaa.com\/video\/rowing\/2022-05-29\/di-2022-rowing-day-three-recap\">two years<\/a>, and Stanford&#x2019;s only hope of winning the national title was to hand the Longhorns their first varsity eight loss in several seasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately for the Cardinal, the Longhorns lived up to expectations, finding an early one-second lead. Though Stanford fought to challenge for the championship, Texas was relentless and extended <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncaa.com\/video\/rowing\/2022-05-29\/di-2022-rowing-day-three-recap\">its lead<\/a> further. The Cardinal ultimately crossed the line as runners-up, just under five seconds behind the Longhorns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though the two teams had an even number of points, the Longhorns&#x2019; win in the varsity eights gave them the championship in a tiebreak.

Ritz\u2019s \u201923 &#8216;Remedy&#8217; marries production and poetics"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>A lecturer in creative writing once told me that a good poem can never be a good song, and vice versa. He claimed that despite the things they share &#x2014; rhyme, lyricism, brevity &#x2014; they could not occupy the same space, exist in the same words.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Singer-songwriter Danny Ritz &#x2019;23 gives lie to this notion with his most recent EP, &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/76f0bfpCntdffu5Rpwcsli?si=Vgmh50-sQA6LzxVtwpwA7A\">Remedy<\/a>,&#x201D; released on Friday. The record is suffused with poetic aphorisms in the tenor of Ada Lim&#xF3;n&#x2019;s sensorily rich lyrics and steeped in the nostalgia of Ocean Vuong&#x2019;s free verse. Ritz&#x2019;s intentionality in composing the seven tracks is evident in his statement of purpose: &#x201C;I wanted to make a project about what it means to heal.&#x201D; The result is an opulent yet whimsical EP that meditates on the nature of memory. &#x201C;Remedy&#x201D; is conceptual yet grounded, swaying in the same fluid atmosphere as a poem while touching upon the most delicate idiosyncrasies of coming of age.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the fall of 2021, Ritz put on a two-night musical event, &#x201C;Brothers: A Theatrical Concert,&#x201D; which included fragments of the songs from &#x201C;Remedy.&#x201D; Ritz deliberately chose the title &#x201C;theatrical concert&#x201D; because the terms &#x201C;concert&#x201D; and &#x201C;musical&#x201D; each felt insufficient to describe the liminal space in which the project existed. Just like &#x201C;Brothers,&#x201D; &#x201C;Remedy&#x201D; resonates infinitely wider than a single medium. These tracks contain so much theoretical and technical depth, it is difficult not to imagine them in a cinematic or multimedia context.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Lily of the Nile,&#x201D; the sixth song on the EP, particularly stands out with its robust lyricism and impressive production. Ritz&#x2019;s voice resounds tender yet mournful, as though serenading his listener: &#x201C;I picked this flower for you \/ cut it straight off the stem \/ I stained my fingers with its flesh \/ a purple flower for you.&#x201D; These lines&#x2019; evocation of such a distinct, fleshy experience operates like a close-up shot, attending to the minutiae of youth. We begin to feel the ink on our fingertips and the pollen in our noses as we listen along. Around a minute into the track, Ritz&#x2019;s weary voice and its distorted echoes join a dreamy piano melody in pouring out unrefined emotion, elevating the composition into an ethereal register. It is the moment when the lovers in a bildungsroman escape the torrents of rain and run into ruins; when Ritz sings &#x201C;Perfect like rubble \/ Whereas I babble on, my Babylon,&#x201D; the catharsis climaxes. &#x201C;Lily of the Nile&#x201D; is a song of undoing oneself to envelop another.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While &#x201C;Lily of the Nile&#x201D; brilliantly uses shifting tempos, transporting listeners to distinct fragments of a memory, the third track on the EP, &#x201C;When the Night (Must Feel Alone),&#x201D; exhibits even more poignant stylistic variation. Beginning with a gentle and refreshingly simple piano solo, &#x201C;When the Night&#x201D; first registers as a ballad in the style of bari-tenor Ben Platt. However, Ritz&#x2019;s soaring vocals and synth-rich outro set it apart from Platt&#x2019;s somnolence. It grows into more of a surrealist mindscape than a muted dreamscape. Ritz arguably delivers his freshest visual and punchiest rhyme with the lines, &#x201C;The stars carve light like holes \/ And still I&#x2019;m falling through \/ Staring down at Earth \/ wondering what I&#x2019;m worth.&#x201D; The barely audible release of the sustain pedal in the final seconds of the quasi-ballad makes for an inspired and intimate ending.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The eponymous track, &#x201C;Remedy,&#x201D; completes the trio of more lyrically driven and slow-paced songs on the EP. Though the name &#x201C;Remedy&#x201D; feels like a trite motif for a record that centers on healing, it well encapsulates Ritz&#x2019;s creative project; he uses memories as a salve, medicine for growing older and losing old selves. The first lines of &#x201C;Remedy&#x201D; are the most somber and the most beautiful lyrics of the entire record. Ritz sings, supported by a beautiful choral backing, &#x201C;I think of you \/ think of the end \/ a plotted graveyard \/ in my head \/ I chase the waves \/ of how we&#x2019;ve bled \/ and chart a shipyard \/ from my bed.&#x201D; Ritz&#x2019;s signature cartographic language again mimics his action of trying to piece together a self in the contours of painful memories. The harmonies linking the end rhymes &#x201C;head\/bed&#x201D; give listeners the sense that his attempts at self-synthesis are beginning to bear fruit, even if only in glimpses.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite Ritz&#x2019;s obvious skill as a more cogitative and poetic lyricist, &#x201C;Remedy&#x201D; is not without its more playful, easy-going tracks. The opener, &#x201C;So Things Are Fair,&#x201D; has a quirky choral introduction that recalls Harry Styles&#x2019; &#x201C;Treat People With Kindness.&#x201D; Like Styles&#x2019; track, &#x201C;So Things Are Fair&#x201D; is charmingly theatrical &#x2014; fitting for Ritz, who has spent much of his life on the stage. It&#x2019;s a Passion Pit-esque song for the sticky indie summer, while making sure not to sacrifice any production value or vocal prowess in existing as such.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its endearing lyrics like &#x201C;We pound our bellies \/ two kettledrums \/ So we can compare \/ our little songs&#x201D; remind us of bedtime stories like &#x201C;Where The Wild Things Are.&#x201D; This storybook charm pairs well with Ritz&#x2019;s unbridled vocals to evoke a childlike joy. With a breezy sing-along chorus and a second-person point of view &#x2014; &#x201C;I sit beside you \/ still as can be \/ I hear inside you \/ our symphony&#x201D; &#x2014; &#x201C;So Things Are Fair&#x201D; perfectly welcomes listeners into Ritz&#x2019;s EP. The dose of trumpet is also delightful, leaving a similar impression as Bleachers&#x2019; saxophone-heavy baroque pop.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Great Pretenders,&#x201D; which follows &#x201C;So Things Are Fair,&#x201D; is perhaps disadvantaged by its position in the EP, as the latter track&#x2019;s relative whim and synth-pop energy overshadows the same qualities in the former. Still, the song is a pleasant listen with some sweeter lyrics, such as &#x201C;Thank God I had your back \/ Thank God you had mine,&#x201D; that are less concerned with profundity than tenderness.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EP&#x2019;s energy is most palpable in &#x201C;Add It Up&#x201D; and &#x201C;Fourth of July.&#x201D; The former track feels at first like an echo of &#x201C;When the Night,&#x201D; but unravels into a series of surprises. Ritz&#x2019;s raspy voice and the groovy bounce of the backing track make &#x201C;Add It Up&#x201D; a perfect dancing-around-the-kitchen-with-cookie-dough-in-hand song. The repeated proclamation &#x201C;I see love&#x201D; triumphantly asserts that the magic in the mundane is merely awaiting our gaze. This is a high art piece that still makes for an easy listen.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, &#x201C;Fourth of July&#x201D; glitters with its digital chimes and lively electric guitar. Fittingly for a closing track, it is the song you remember the most and the one you find yourself coming back to, again and again. For a moment, Ritz&#x2019;s pronunciation of &#x201C;hoping&#x201D; sounds like &#x201C;hold me&#x201D; &#x2014; almost an invitation into an embrace. This song simply has so much warmth to share. Repeating the phrase &#x201C;It&#x2019;s up to you&#x201D; throughout the outro, Ritz seemingly offers us agency not only in crafting our own listening experience, but also in crafting our lives.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Remedy&#x201D; is ultimately an EP that defers to us; we are invited into it but not prescribed any one way to exist in its atmosphere. Ritz&#x2019;s prismatic talents as a songwriter, poet and producer are evidenced in this project, but most importantly, the record radiates his vibrant imagination.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article is a review and includes subjective opinions, thoughts and critiques.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;Remedy,&#8221;

baseball wins first two games at Pac-12 Tournament, advances to semifinals"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>In its first game of the inaugural Pac-12 Tournament, No. 1 seed Stanford baseball (39-14, 21-9) faced off against No. 8 Arizona State (26-31, 13-17 Pac-12) and won 6-3.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Head coach David Esquer started freshman pitcher Ty Uber, who has started in eight games this season. Both teams were able to keep hitters at bay through four innings, as the game remained scoreless. During the fourth inning, Esquer pulled Uber from the mound and replaced him with sophomore pitcher Drew Dowd.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Stanford struggled during Dowd&#x2019;s reign on the mound. An error from third baseman Drew Bowser gave Arizona State its first run in the fifth inning. Then, in the sixth, Dowd gave up back-to-back hits, which induced RBIs and put Arizona State ahead at 3-1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bowser made up for his fifth inning error by hitting an RBI single to left field in the sixth inning to cut the Sun Devils&#x2019; lead to 3-2. Next, in the seventh, after junior shortstop Adam Crampton hit a single up the middle, junior outfielder Brock Jones hit a big fly to right field to give Stanford its first lead of the game, 4-3. Next inning, Bowser matched Jones by hitting a two-run home run himself, which put the Cardinal up 6-3.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After sophomore Ryan Bruno and junior Quinn Mathews came in for Dowd, the Cardinal did not give up any runs for the remainder of the game and survived a scare, 6-3.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up, the Cardinal played No. 4 seed Arizona (36-22, 16-14 Pac-12), a team that swept them during the regular season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cardinal&#x2019;s bats continued to hit for power in this game, a trend that has reared its head during the latter part of the season.&nbsp; Sophomore second baseman Tommy Troy hit a solo home run in the top of the second inning, a two-run bomb in the top of the 5th and an RBI double in the top of the 6th, which gave him four RBIs on the day. Bowser also had a multi-home run day, hitting a solo shot in the top of the second inning and a three-run big fly in the top of the seventh inning. Junior DH Brett Barrera joined in on the home run fest, hitting a solo homer in the top of the third inning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this game, Esquer decided to start the Pac-12 Pitcher of the Year, Alex Williams, on the mound. Williams struggled by his standards in his appearance on the mound, as he gave up four earned runs, including three in the third inning. After 4.2 innings, Esquer pulled Williams and put in sophomore pitcher Tommy O&#x2019;Rourke. O&#x2019;Rourke pitched 2.1 innings before sophomore pitcher Brandt Pancer pitched the 7th-9th innings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through two games, it seems Esquer is trying to preserve his pitching staff&#x2019;s stamina, as only one pitcher has pitched more than four innings.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking ahead, Stanford will play the winner of Arizona\/Arizona State in the conference tournament semifinal. The Cardinal&nbsp;will have a bit of a cushion, as they will have to lose two games against their opponent to be eliminated from the tournament, while their opponent will be eliminated with just one more loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, regardless of what happens in the tournament, Stanford is in prime position to host a regional and super-regional because of its regular season record.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First pitch in the conference semifinal is scheduled for 9 a.m. PT on Saturday. If a second game must be played, it is scheduled to begin at 4:45 p.m. PT.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In its first game of the inaugural Pac-12 Tournament, No. 1 seed

He told a story of a little boy evacuated from Mariupol, a city overrun by Russian forces. After evacuation, the boy invited his rescuers to his home next summer, saying &#x201C;there is no town, but the sea is still there.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;This story is about life,&#x201D; Zelenskyy said. &#x201C;Life always winning over death and that matters the most for everyone.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not the first time the president has visited Stanford &#x2014; Zelenskyy <a href=\"https:\/\/fsi.stanford.edu\/news\/%E2%80%98everything-possible-ukraine%E2%80%99-president-volodymyr-zelensky-addresses-stanford-community-during\">came to campus<\/a> in September under vastly different circumstances. Then, his message was &#x201C;everything is possible in Ukraine.&#x201D; He encouraged the audience to actualize this sentiment by helping rebuild Ukraine in &#x201C;the biggest project on defending freedom that your generation can partake in.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emphasizing the strong emotional connection between Ukrainians and Americans, he offered his condolences on the recent school shooting in Uvalde, Texas that killed 19 elementary school children and two teachers. &#x201C;In these terrible times when American people express their condolences because of death in Ukraine at war, we express our condolences because of death in peace,&#x201D; he said.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students had the opportunity to ask questions after the address in a Q&amp;A moderated by FSI director and former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul &#x2019;86 M.A. &#x2019;86. The president&#x2019;s answers covered topics from grassroots activism to advice for Stanford students.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"6000\" height=\"4000\" src=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/063EF652-CB79-42F1-A4C4-3F2A48CD24AD.jpeg?w=800\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1204858\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/063EF652-CB79-42F1-A4C4-3F2A48CD24AD.jpeg 6000w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/063EF652-CB79-42F1-A4C4-3F2A48CD24AD.jpeg?resize=600,400 600w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/063EF652-CB79-42F1-A4C4-3F2A48CD24AD.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/063EF652-CB79-42F1-A4C4-3F2A48CD24AD.jpeg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/063EF652-CB79-42F1-A4C4-3F2A48CD24AD.jpeg?resize=800,533 800w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/063EF652-CB79-42F1-A4C4-3F2A48CD24AD.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/063EF652-CB79-42F1-A4C4-3F2A48CD24AD.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 6000px) 100vw, 6000px\" \/><figcaption><em>FSI Director Michael McFaul mediates the discussion, backed by the American and Ukrainian flags.

Reaching her home community on social media is imperative to break the information bubble, he said, &#x201C;because they do not read me anymore, I am sure.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;You see the truth, you get the knowledge from the United States,&#x201D; Zelenskyy said. &#x201C;You can demonstrate the world which is bigger than Russia, which is bigger than Ukraine and any country for that matter. And we have to remove the frontiers, open the border and bring the truth in with knowledge, with conviction and persuasion.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Co-founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.telehelpukraine.com\/i-want-to-help-1\">TeleHelp Ukraine<\/a> Solomiia Savchuk M.D. &#x2019;24 asked the President what could be done to support access to healthcare both during the war and after the conflict.

After joking with the audience about his &#x201C;still young&#x201D; age (the President is 44 years old), Zelenskyy drew a contrast between students who are studying in universities and some young Ukrainians who stand in lines to get drafted. He emphasized the privilege of the college experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Not all of them will see a chance to write a thesis, and not all of them will stay alive,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s why I would like to wish to all the students a long and interesting life &#x2026; Receive some sort of pleasure in the lectures or after the lectures, but you have to enjoy your life.&#x201D;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What matters most to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy?

Women&#x2019;s March.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Freedman, an American historian has been at Stanford since 1976. In her time here, Freedman has written on various gender and sexuality related topics, including lesbianism, prison reform, rape culture and maternal justice. She also co-founded the undergraduate Program in <a href=\"https:\/\/feminist.stanford.edu\/\">Feminist, Gender and Sexuality Studies (FGSS).<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost half a century later (and several feminist movements later), Freedman is teaching her final class at Stanford, FEMGEN161: &#x201C;The Politics of Sex.&#x201D; This course aims to unpack &#x201C;the transition from Victorian to modern American womanhood by asking how Native, European, African, Mexican, and Asian American women navigated the changing sexual, economic, and political landscapes of the twentieth century,&#x201D; according to ExploreCourses.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eva Jones &#x2019;25 decided to take the class after getting enticed by the name. &#x201C;Then I heard Freedman was coming out of retirement to teach,&#x201D; she wrote.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Jones, Freedman has created a &#x201C;curious classroom&#x201D; and teaches in a way that &#x201C;holds everyone&#8217;s attention raptly.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;After the first day, I was obsessed,&#x201D; she wrote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, Freedman taught the introductory seminar FEMGEN 63N: The Feminist Critique, which, according to it&#x2019;s ExploreCourses description, aimed to tackle the &#x201C;long history of ideas about gender and equality.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karen Cho &#x2019;24, who decided to take the IntroSem to &#x201C;deepen [her] understanding of various nuances of feminist thought that different thinkers advocated for,&#x201D; had similar praises of the professor&#x2019;s commitment to her classroom.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;She really wants to see her students grow and succeed as feminist thinkers, writers, and advocates,&#x201D; Cho wrote.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though the subjects of the classes she taught varied, both students noted the emphasis on intersectionality as one of their favorite parts of their experience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In &#x201C;The Feminist Critique,&#x201D; Cho found herself excited by contextualizing feminist thought in larger social movements.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was intrigued by the way the feminist thought interacted with other social movements. &#x201C;Feminist thinkers never really pondered feminism alone,&#x201D; she explained, &#x201C;but rather in conversation with issues of racism and classism in their respective communities.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jane Belcaster &#x2019;24 has been working alongside Freedman to crowdfund, research and do social media outreach for Freedman&#x2019;s current decade-long project, <a href=\"https:\/\/singingforjustice.com\/\">Singing for Justice<\/a>, a documentary that tells the story of Faith Petric and how folk music shaped a century of activism.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From that role, Belcaster had the opportunity to become Freedman&#x2019;s student assistant, helping her with research and other administrative tasks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s difficult to overstate how lucky and grateful I feel to have both studied under and been mentored by Professor Freedman,&#x201D; Belcaster wrote about her experience. Belcaster says the professor has always made her feel heard at all times, perpetually practicing a level of care she described as profound.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Belcaster wants the Stanford community to continue to &#x201C;use Professor Freedman&#x2019;s lessons to continue inspiring new generations of campus activism.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Cho and Jones, Freedman has left Belcaster focused on the importance of intersectionality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;We must recognize that all social issues should be viewed through the intersections of personal experiences, of different identities, as Professor Freedman has shown in her work. Without intersectionality, our movements are weak,&#x201D; she concluded.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reflecting on her years at Stanford, Freedman recalled the initial difficulties of co-founding the FGSS program at Stanford. Women&#x2019;s Studies was fairly new to the United States at the time &#x2014; less than a decade old &#x2014; and most research universities were skeptical of the field.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many scholars in different humanities and social science departments began co-teaching and asking questions about feminist analysis together, and students began declaring individually designerd majors in Women&#x2019;s Studies. Yet, amidst the rising popularity of the program, there still remained backlash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;When we created a proposal for a program and took it to the appropriate committees, people were very skeptical, especially because we wanted to call it Feminist Studies,&#x201D; Freedman said. &#x201C;They felt it was a fad that would go away. They felt that it was too political.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It took a decade for Stanford to finally make FGSS a degree-granting program. &#x201C;There were people who said we will not support having the word &#x2018;feminist&#x2019; on a Stanford degree,&#x201D; Freedman recalled. &#x201C;It took a changing of the guard, and for people to come along and realize that this is very serious scholarship.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Professor Freedman is moved by the way FGSS has grown and expanded since the turn of the century.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking forward, Professor Freedman believes that the FGSS program will continue focusing on scholarship surrounding resistance. Given contemporary conflicts over gender and sexuality &#x2014; such as conflicts surrounding abortion or contemporary transgender politics &#x2014; she said we can&#x2019;t assume that rights that have been achieved in the last 50 years are necessarily secure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;We think that there&#8217;s been this narrative of acceptance, and you realize that there&#8217;s so many challenges happening in terms of American politics that make it look very different,&#x201D; Freedman said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Above all, Freedman hopes to inspire her students to think towards change.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Much as I would love them to learn the content and what happened historically, I want to provide students ways of thinking in the future,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I want the examples to create a framework for thinking about change over time, about the historical contexts that make change

On average, less than a third of our public school students are <a href=\"https:\/\/edsource.org\/2020\/less-than-a-third-of-california-students-met-or-exceeded-standards-on-new-science-test\/623514\">proficient<\/a> in math and less than half are <a href=\"https:\/\/calmatters.org\/commentary\/2020\/01\/functional-illiteracy\/\">proficient<\/a> in reading. And student performance continues to worsen overtime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The response from the governor has been to attempt to basically <a href=\"https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/california\/story\/2021-05-20\/california-controversial-math-overhaul-focuses-on-equity\">dumb<\/a> down education for everybody which is grossly inappropriate and unfair to everybody. It&#8217;s also bad for society. We need educated people to be globally competitive, to be prosperous, to maintain our society and our civilization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I&#8217;m proposing is a citizens jury &#x2014; which is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.civicus.org\/documents\/toolkits\/PGX_B_Citizens%20JuryFinalWeb.pdf\">process<\/a> of creating a randomly selected representative sample of the electorate &#x2014; to deliberate the future of education in public and a series of townhall meetings for nine months. It would be done in multiple cities, and at the end of that process, those recommendations would go back to the legislature. Then the legislature will have its own hearings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem in California has mostly been political. The teachers union has opposed greater school choice. But while teachers are important stakeholders in our schools, they should not be in charge of schools. Schools are the responsibility of the whole society.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TSD: As someone who once identified with the Democratic Party but walked away from it, what do you think your relationship could be with the legislature &#x2014; which is dominated by the Democratic Party?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>MS:<\/strong> One of mutual respect and open disagreement, I suspect. There may be a possibility of going to ballot <a href=\"https:\/\/ballotpedia.org\/Ballot_initiative\">initiatives<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The history of California over the last 50 years has heavily <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sos.ca.gov\/elections\/ballot-measures\/resources-and-historical-information\/history-california-initiatives\">depended<\/a> on direct voter ballot referendums. It&#x2019;s more expensive to do it that way, it&#x2019;s very high stakes and it doesn&#x2019;t allow the deliberation that the legislative process allows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#x2019;d rather see things done through the legislature than through direct ballot initiatives. But when the legislature is captured by special interests, going directly to voters is often the only way to enact change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TSD: On the topic of changes, you are a very large proponent of nuclear energy. How do you think that you will be able to implement it in California &#x2014; where there is very strong resistance?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>MS<\/strong>: There was very strong resistance when I started <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/06\/30\/opinion\/how-not-to-deal-with-climate-change.html\">advocating<\/a> for Diablo Canyon to remain open in 2016. We now see that there&#8217;s a plurality of voters <a href=\"https:\/\/world-nuclear-news.org\/Articles\/Californian-support-grows-for-Diablo-Canyon-poll\">support<\/a> for keeping the application open. So we have seen a very significant shift in opinion on nuclear power in a very short period of time.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m very proud of the role that I&#8217;ve played in that through my TED <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ted.com\/speakers\/michael_shellenberger\">talks<\/a>, my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ecomodernism.org\/manifesto-english\/\">writings<\/a> and my <a href=\"https:\/\/environmentalprogress.org\/founder-president\">advocacy<\/a>. As Governor, I&#8217;ll continue to play what I hope is a positive and educational role in getting nuclear greater acceptance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also helps that we&#8217;re in the worst energy crisis and 50 years facing blackouts for the fourth season in a row. Those blackouts are a direct result of Gavin Newsom&#x2019;s failure as a governor to build enough power plants. When things go wrong as a result of Gavin Newsom&#x2019;s policies, he looks around for somebody to blame. And when he can&#8217;t find anybody to blame, he blames climate change. But of course, we&#8217;ve known about climate change since the late 1980s. Newsom epitomizes the irresponsible attitude towards governance in California, which is why we&#8217;re in simultaneous crises on homelessness, crime, energy and water.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When used safely, nuclear is the safest way to make electricity. That may seem paradoxical, but the reality is that because nuclear power produces no air or water pollution, it has far fewer impacts on human health than fossil fuels do. It&#8217;s also far more concentrated than renewables, as solar and wind require 300-400 times more land than nuclear. We&#8217;ve been <a href=\"https:\/\/defenders.org\/blog\/2019\/09\/tortoise-and-solar-panel\">killing<\/a> desert tortoises, the <a href=\"https:\/\/statesymbolsusa.org\/symbol-official-item\/california\/state-reptile\/desert-tortoise\">state<\/a> reptile and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.endangeredspeciesinternational.org\/deserttortoise.html\">threatened<\/a> species under the Endangered Species Act.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We wouldn&#8217;t do more solar in California. We have this beautifully operated and well maintained plant in Diablo Canyon that&#x2019;s consistently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nrc.gov\/info-finder\/reactors\/diab2.html\">classified<\/a> by the US nuclear regulatory commission as one of the highest performing nuclear plants in the country. So not only will we keep Diablo Canyon operating, we will also explore whether we can build the first meltdown proof nuclear <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nrc.gov\/info-finder\/decommissioning\/power-reactor\/san-onofre-unit-1.html\">plant<\/a> at Santa Onofre. There&#8217;s every reason that California should be a leader and innovation leader when it comes to nuclear rather than a laggard.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TSD: You&#x2019;ve done this a little bit, but how would you describe Gavin Newsom as a governor?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>MS:<\/strong> Total failure. He&#x2019;s failing the California people because he&#x2019;s never cared about people beyond whether they can help him achieve his next office. When he was a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, he wanted to be mayor. When he was mayor, he wanted to be governor. When it was clear he couldn&#8217;t become governor, he accepted lieutenant governor. But then all he could focus on was being governor. Now all he cares about is becoming president either in 2024 or 2028.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is the worst of the Machiavellian politicians; he treats people as a means to an end rather than as an end. He kept our kids out of public schools in classroom instruction, even though he sent his own kids to classroom instruction or private schools. He&#8217;s not somebody of the people. He&#8217;s an elitist snob who never worked a day in his life for anything beyond the things that were given to him. His wealth was inherited, his power was inherited. He&#8217;s a legacy of the aristocratic class in California. Just look at his attitude. He wouldn&#8217;t wear masks while making little kids wear masks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A real leader will follow his own rules. And a real leader will impose sacrifices on himself before he imposes them on others. He does the opposite. Every time there&#8217;s a crisis, he looks for somebody else to blame. When he can&#8217;t find anybody to blame, he blames climate change. He epitomizes everything that&#8217;s wrong in California. He&#8217;s a product of good times. Good times create weak leaders, and weak leaders trade bad times. We&#8217;re in the midst of bad times, and we need a strong leader.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Shellenberger and the incumbent Governor Gavin Newsom will face 13 Republicans,

latest releases in rock, jazz, experimental&#8230; and pretty much everything else. Brandon Rupp (also known by his mononymous musical title &#x201C;beandon,&#x201D; under which he releases music and DJs as KZSU&#x2019;s Student Music Director) explores a new title and gives unfiltered feedback, regardless of the genre. Feel free to send him music; he&#x2019;d love to take a look!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Destroyer&#x2019;s Dan Bejar is a musician who, above all else, has been ridiculously consistent. Not complacent, mind you, as his work reveals he is quite the opposite &#x2014; he has been able to take the very best elements of popular indie rock and shape them into his own singular, highly literary project. With a career that has shifted through Bowie-esque glam-rock, quick bursts of lo-fi pop &#xE0; la Guided by Voices or the Magnetic Fields, and straight up yacht rock and lounge music worship, delving into Bejar&#x2019;s back catalog reveals an artist always eager to challenge his own conceptions of what it means to write a &#x201C;Destroyer song.&#x201D; With his latest album, &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/63bs2cLZO9wm6hvhovU1AU?si=4Pe9KSWlRWOY4YmZofOnYQ\">Labyrinthitis<\/a>,&#x201D; Bejar still finds ways to develop his artistry thirteen albums in, forming one of his best works yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The album is, much as its title would imply, a labyrinth of melodies, witty asides, colloquial expressions and prose poetry that recalls T. S. Eliot. However, just as the true definition of the word &#x201C;labyrinthitis&#x201D; is &#x201C;inflammation of the inner ear,&#x201D; the importance is in what you hear. Instrumental dance grooves propel lyrical spoken word passages interspersed with vaguely spoke-sung segments (with even the occasional full-on melodic crooning). The overall splendor has been notched up to 11 as well, especially coming off their more restrained last album, &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/2lxvrP32vU3oRjEEKTSHUr?si=YdzsFRbNRS6Yga6ahtk8fw\">Have We Met<\/a>.&#x201D; In one song, a g&#xFC;iro aggressively pierces through the mix; another features pitch-shifted vocal samples that formulate a wordless melodic motif. However, all of the musical and stylistic elements packed into this dense paragraph may sound jarring and discordant for those not initiated into the cult of Bejar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got a chance to speak to Dan Bejar in anticipation of Destroyer&#x2019;s Berkeley concert last Saturday. Dan spoke of his recent reads, including works by authors Renee Gladman and Patrick Modiano. His highly literary sensibilities came out in full force, but his love of film also shined through. When discussing Thomas Pynchon&#x2019;s &#x201C;Inherent Vice,&#x201D; he made sure to note that &#x201C;the movie turned out better.&#x201D; Past the discussion of literature, he described how he grapples with playing songs that are sometimes upwards of two decades old and were written when he was in an unrecognizable headspace.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I used to approach tackling 22-year-old songs with a certain amount of dread,&#x201D; Bejar said. &#x201C;But the Destroyer live band is the great equalizer. They tear everything to shreds, no matter how many awkward chord changes or strange word choices I might&#x2019;ve leaned into in my 20s.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These supposedly &#x201C;awkward&#x201D; or &#x201C;strange&#x201D; musical moments have comprised some of the most revered albums in indie music. The wide discography of Destroyer has produced at least a few classics which are well worth briefly delving into. They can hopefully serve as both an easy entry into the band for incoming listeners and also important context for the release of &#x201C;Labyrinthitis.&#x201D; Arguably, Bejar&#x2019;s first masterpiece was the elegant art rock of &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/38cQRGYizjgBCivjIqF6kk?si=vu1Q2yC3RvinhVpy33_5Hw\">Streethawk: A Seduction<\/a>,&#x201D; which recalled Bowie&#x2019;s Ziggy Stardust era, if it were interpreted by Walt Whitman. He continued to develop the sound and style of that record into the equally masterful &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/1VTq7Bn60Qic2E9nMhZ0Ii?si=nJh-ZYIZQ6ek-4ml-fVdkg\">Destroyer&#x2019;s Rubies<\/a>,&#x201D; a chamber pop spectacle that featured his best compositions to date. Next, 2010&#x2019;s &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/4sVWj2lb9F8nRg57VFTaf1?si=4qnPD4k1Sa-I1oAHtIVLQw\">Kaputt<\/a>&#x201D; virtually redefined the band &#x2014; out with the crunchy guitars and in with synth-heavy, glossy sophisti-pop which frequently veered into easy listening territory.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A description of those three records should be enough to showcase the sheer range of styles that Bejar is able to juggle, but they don&#x2019;t intend to imply the absence of a classic Destroyer sound. In fact, you could probably tell if a Destroyer track was playing in the next room over if you listened for Bejar&#x2019;s trademarks. For one, his poetic lyric sheets read like words at war &#x2014; clashing abstractions which, through the power of melody, are warped into bizarre earworms. One of their most straight-forward pop ditties, &#x201C;Your Blood,&#x201D; has the dynamic chorus of &#x201C;They were alright, they were on fire \/ They harbored an elementary desire to do good works.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, Bejar&#x2019;s voice &#x2014; both physically and on the page &#x2014; is pronounced and packed with acerbic wit. He sings in a quasi-British accent that simply becomes something the listener grows to love from the eccentric Canadian. On &#x201C;Labyrinthitis,&#x201D; none of these markers are absent, and Bejar instead finds new ways to develop his creative voice even further.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take the track &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/track\/7AgYt50shbiD9QZtZKFp3q?si=79d703e2d20a4ed1\">June<\/a>&#x201D; for example. While the track begins as a Kaputt-esque dance pop number with slap bass and disco drums, his voice slowly devolves into a pitch-shifted stream-of-consciousness poem unlike any other moment from Destroyer&#x2019;s discography. &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/track\/4hNlGoJ9rgKaMSBermXqwZ?si=c57cf51b03af41ac\">Tintoretto, It&#x2019;s for You<\/a>&#x201D; features sharp stabs of synthesizer akin to particularly aggressive 80s pop juxtaposed with elegant jazz piano chords and a militant bassline. None of these elements have ever found their way into the band&#x2019;s music previously, but they don&#x2019;t feel out of place. If anything, the listener is left wondering why it took them thirteen albums to enter what feels like such natural and compelling musical territory. This is, in my view, the mark of a good artist: one who can be over 25 years deep into their craft and still produce art that feels purposeful and unique.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With &#x201C;Labyrinthitis,&#x201D; Bejar has simply used his elaborate musical and literary vocabulary to find a new way to impress. As a result, this review cannot take the form of much more than a stressed recommendation to open your heart to all that is Destroyer. I could have instead done a song-by-song breakdown, but it would go against the point of the band in the first place. Dan Bejar makes music to revel in; music to analyze; music to fall in love with.

in 2016. He co-founded an insurtech startup and now lives in Miami, Fla. Ned Chambers received his B.S. in human biology in 1973. He recently retired from a neighborhood family medical practice in San Diego. Neither belonged to a housed fraternity while at Stanford.<\/em><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In her opinion <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/04\/27\/from-the-community-dear-admin-we-know-you-dont-work-for-us\/\">piece<\/a> published Apr. 27, former undergraduate Alex Young (a founding member of Abolish Stanford Greek) questions why only Greek organizations deserve campus housing over what she contends are 650+ open membership clubs on campus. Her suggestion is that because members of these other organizations do not have the option to stay multiple years in their residences, nobody should have that option. We argue that instead of ending this option for the fewer than 500 students who now benefit, it should be expanded to all students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Acknowledging a housing shortage, the original row houses were built by Greek alumni to meet a severe housing shortage for undergraduates. In response, alumni raised what would be tens of millions in today&#x2019;s dollars to assist the University in housing undergraduates. The organizations that did so raised funds that both increased the undergraduate housing supply and allowed the organization&#x2019;s students to be housed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 1960s, Greek alumni were approached again and encouraged to abandon their Row houses to build even more student housing on the Knoll and by Lake Lagunita. They were once again asked to be the principal funders of new undergraduate housing. One group, Sigma Chi (550 Lasuen), rejected the offer, but continues to maintain their own property under a lease with the University, paying a 6-figure ground lease rent and performed a multi-million dollar <a href=\"https:\/\/oac.cdlib.org\/findaid\/ark:\/13030\/kt0d5nf2mc\/entire_text\/\">renovation<\/a> in 2006.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ms. Young&#x2019;s proposed solution to what she perceives as an inequity is the opposite of what ought to be University policy. The real solution here is not taking away the option of multi-year housing from the fewer than 500 students in those residences; it is offering that type of housing to <em>all<\/em> students who want it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Ms. Young cites statistics that are several years old, this spring&#x2019;s rush tells us how dramatically undergraduate housing demand has increased in the years since Ms. Young was an undergraduate. As one example, over 435 Stanford men rushed fraternities this year, according to our conversations with the IFC. Only about 200 received bids. We estimate that less than half of them will be able to live in a Greek residence next year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorority rush this spring saw similar numbers. 396 students rushed sororities; 254 received bids. Demand was also way up for students rushing groups in the Multicultural Greek Council (MGC) and African-American Fraternal &amp; Sororal Association (AAFSA). Given strong demand, the University should find ways to add more Greek housing options rather than removing existing housing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Approximately a thousand students (versus a freshman class of 2,350) wanted to join Greek lettered organizations this spring. The housed Greek organizations draw the greatest interest. These students likely want to live in multi-year housing largely to develop the <a href=\"https:\/\/news.gallup.com\/opinion\/gallup\/173630\/fraternity-sorority-membership-linked-higher-college-grads.aspx\">closer<\/a> relationships and lifetime bonds <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npcwomen.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2037\/2017\/07\/gallup-purdue_index_-_fraternities_and_sororities_understanding_life_outcomes.pdf\">created<\/a> in such an environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on our assessment of housing capacity, we estimate that the 10 houses now assigned to Greek organizations can hold just under 500 students. This spring&#x2019;s rush suggests that there&#x2019;s demand for Greek housing by as many as 3300 students, given a spring rush of 831 multiplied by four class years. A more conservative estimate might put this number around 2500 &#x2014; still five times the available supply.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ms. Young contends that this dynamic is unfair. What she does not share, and presumably does not know, is that it is Greek alumni who for at least 15 years have lobbied the University to dramatically expand this housing option to all students. Given the lack of similar housing options for non-Greek students, it is evidently the Office of Student Affairs that stubbornly <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2018\/05\/16\/a-history-of-housing-shortages-how-the-university-accommodates-consistent-growth\/\">resists<\/a> doing so. The University should be meeting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/silicon-valley-housing-crisis-ensnares-stanford-11555254001\">demand<\/a> by either increasing the supply of Greek residences or letting all other student organizations and students have an opportunity to live in an expanded pool of similar residences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of placing blame with the Office of Student Affairs, Ms. Young contends there is &#x201C;only one explanation for all this: donor influence.&#x201D; She claims it is &#x201C;well known that Greek alumni donate more to their universities than non-Greek alumni.&#x201D; She asserts that Greek alumni tend to be the &#x201C;wealthiest and the most powerful alumni.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether Ms. Young&#x2019;s claim that the University&#x2019;s most successful alumni are Greek is accurate or not, it is undisputed that Greek alumni do contribute significantly more at most schools, including Stanford. There is a reason. Ms. Young&#x2019;s linked documents establish that students in Greek life are more likely to say they formed relationships with mentors and professors, were more active in extracurricular activities and had better access to internships. All of these positive outcomes are the necessary by-product of the relationships and lifetime bonds that are created by living with a diverse group of roughly 50 individuals from different class years for multiple years in the <em>same<\/em> Stanford residence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alumni who strongly bond with their university as a student will be more bonded as an alum. They volunteer more. They give more. Stanford would do a service to all its students (and its endowment) by dramatically increasing the housing stock devoted to multi-year living options for all students and organizations. Let supply rise to meet the overwhelming demand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stanford has formed a new task force to see how to restore fun to the campus. One solution is to make everybody happy with their housing options, instead of making everyone equally unhappy as Ms. Young proposes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Alumni Reid Spitz and Ned Chambers argue for expanded Greek housing options, responding to Abolish Stanford Greek. &#8220;students in Greek life are more likely to say they formed relationships with mentors and professors, were more active in extracurricular activities and had better access to internships,&#8221;

Keep an eye out and you might be surprised to see what you find.

the 2022-2023 council during its Wednesday meeting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The swearing in ceremony was facilitated by new Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU) vice president Christian Sanchez &#x2019;22, who was <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/04\/26\/darryl-thompson-23-and-christian-sanchez-24-elected-as-2021-22-assu-president-vice-president\/\">elected<\/a> to the executive body in the 2022 ASSU general election. During the ceremony, each member of the new council was asked to take an oath of office.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During its meeting <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/05\/19\/gsc-approves-voting-members-urges-sustainability-school-to-refuse-fossil-fuel-funding\/\">last week<\/a>, the outgoing council certified the <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1bKXGWzG234xm6Ut8UVCR6PTnwt68nU-P\/edit\">results<\/a> of the election of the new council after filling the remaining two GSC positions representing the Graduate School of Business and Graduate School of Education. The two positions required additional deliberations after the election because of a tie between multiple write-in candidates. Wednesday&#x2019;s meeting is the last of the quarter for the current council, which will be replaced by the new council starting next week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Schell, a fourth-year Ph.D. student in developmental and psychological sciences, and Anderson, a third-year Ph.D. student in aeronautics and astronautics, were unanimously elected co-chairs of the new council. The confirmation vote is the first taken by the new council.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incumbent councilor and fifth-year Ph.D. student in modern thought and literature Jamie Fine endorsed the new co-chairs ahead of the vote, praising Schell and Anderson for their involvement with the council throughout the school year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;They are different personalities who will work well together,&#x201D; Fine said. &#x201C;As a leadership team, I think that they&#x2019;re going to be very helpful in bringing to the table more graduate voices.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one of the final votes of the school year for the outgoing council, the GSC <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1nvIFDyOZ3u3YleXQJtC0CcjiEGHjHvrld4Roicdeyp0\/edit\">confirmed<\/a> Jas Espinosa &#x2019;18 M.A. &#x2019;19 as the Financial Manager and CEO of Stanford Student Enterprises (SSE). Espinosa has previously served as a business operations manager for SSE and an undergraduate senator for the ASSU.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m very humbled and honored to be running for this position,&#x201D; Espinosa said. &#x201C;SSE has always been a landing page for me in my professional trajectory.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mail and package issues were back on the table as councilors heard from Residential &amp; Dining Enterprises (R&amp;DE) representatives during their biweekly meeting with the council. The GSC has been engaged in <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/05\/12\/gsc-zeroes-in-on-missing-mail-returned-packages-and-resolving-election-ties\/\">discussion<\/a> with R&amp;DE representatives throughout the year over numerous mail and package issues, including mail being returned to sender.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Executive Director of R&amp;DE Student Housing Operations Imogen Hinds, the United States Postal Service (USPS) has continued to request examples of mail being returned to sender as it investigates student complaints about this issue. Although returned mail remains a perplexing problem for R&amp;DE, it has been able to figure out what is happening with most student mailing complaints, Hinds said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added that UG2, which serves as Stanford&#x2019;s mail service provider, is cooperating with R&amp;DE to provide the information necessary to further examine the mailing issues. Hinds stressed R&amp;DE&#x2019;s commitment to resolving these issues as quickly as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;This is definitely something that is frustrating, and as the current council knows, we&#x2019;ve been working on this for quite some time,&#x201D; Hinds said. &#x201C;We really don&#x2019;t want this to have to continue.

Y2K trends: iPods, low-rise jeans and homeownership"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s out with the old, in with the new&#x201D; &#x2014; as Sharpay Evans so aptly sang in the 2007 film High School Musical 2, the times are changing. Earlier this month, Apple officially discontinued the iPod, a miniature portable music player, after 20 years of its celebrated existence as an emblem of the Y2K era. As netizens mourn this tragic news, let&#x2019;s take a trip down memory lane and rate some of the most iconic Y2K trends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Low-Rise Jeans<br><\/em>One of the most controversial trends on this list, low-rise jeans have their fair share of fans and detractors. These jeans, however, are incredibly versatile. With the low cut enabling tiny, if nonexistent, pockets, you can snugly fit your iPod Nano in the crease of your hip. Better yet: layer your jeans with a dress for a powerful statement that screams fashionable indecision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>In-Person Bullying<br><\/em>Social media can be quite a monster, especially for younger users. Today&#x2019;s youth are either victimized by rumors on gigantic online group chats or sent hateful private messages via anonymous fake accounts. Remember the days when everything was IRL? Sure, that one kid from my math class kept insulting my Sketchers shoes, but at least I could argue back with him face-to-face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Britney Spears Songs<br><\/em>With global warming and pollution boosting the growth of harmful algal blooms in our oceans, Britney&#x2019;s hit song Toxic from 2003 really nailed it, even two decades later. In fact, climate change may lead to a <a href=\"https:\/\/agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/2015GL066235\">20% increase<\/a> in toxic algal blooms in the next century. With iconic bops that remain relevant so many years later, Britney&#x2019;s music is definitely a winner on this list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tweezing your Eyebrows<br><\/em>As a thick-eyebrowed person, I am more than happy to let this trend retire. Although patches of redness and ingrown hairs resulting from over-tweezing can perhaps carry their own messages as purposeful vessels of fashion, our foreheads are surely grateful for the well-deserved rest (and we can all aspire to be Cara Delevigne).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Homeownership<\/em><br>Before the 2008 recession, home ownership was on the rise. Subprime mortgage offers had everyone gaping at the Tuscan kitchens on HGTV and searching for the best neon inflatable couches for their dens. Of course, since then, homeownership rates have fallen such that today&#x2019;s millennials are less likely to own a home than their parents were at their age. Will this declining trend make a comeback later? Only time will tell&#x2026;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>iPods<\/em><br>The namesake of this list and the ultimate Y2K trend, it is with a heavy heart that we acknowledge its culmination. The iPods&#x2019; portable size and range of colors truly comprised the cutting edge of technology. If you miss feeling like the main character of your own Y2K era chick-flick, blasting Imma Be and Cry Me a River through these bad boys, then you may still be in luck.

href=\"http:\/\/sccgov.iqm2.com\/Citizens\/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?Frame=&amp;MeetingID=13958&amp;MediaPosition=&amp;ID=110756&amp;CssClass=\">report<\/a> released Tuesday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report comes after the Tuesday school shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas. As of Wednesday, a gunman&#x2019;s rampage has killed 19 children and two teachers. The latest shooting has ignited a wave of outrage across the country, re-energizing calls for government action to prevent the gun violence epidemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this report has been years in the making &#x2014; Santa Clara County Supervisor Cindy Chavez requested the report in 2019 after the Gilroy Garlic Festival <a href=\"https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/california\/story\/2019-07-28\/reports-of-shooting-at-gilroy-garlic-festival\">shooting<\/a> that killed three people, though the report was delayed by the pandemic. The $72 million figure includes costs at the county and city level for police, emergency services, medical, mental health, emergency services and criminal justice. It does not account for the costs of incarceration in state and federal prisons. The healthcare system, criminal justice system and other public sectors bear the majority of this monetary impact.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Columbine, Sandy Hook, Marjorie Stoneman Douglas and now Robb,&#x201D; Chavez said. &#x201C;We keep adding school names to the list of mass shooting sites. We keep burying kids and leaving families consumed by grief. And we can&#x2019;t say, &#x2018;But it won&#x2019;t happen here,&#x2019; because it did.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common causes for the 1,494 firearm deaths over the past two decades were self-inflicted injuries such as suicide, followed by assault\/homicide and legal intervention.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report recommends a series of policy actions, including the adoption of gun-safety policies for gun owners, community-centered approaches to gun-violence prevention policies, and partnerships with health services to improve mental health care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Santa Clara County residents owned 550,000 guns in 2021 with 28,000 guns registered annually from 2017 to 2021, according to the report.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To address the issue of &#x201C;ghost guns&#x201D; &#x2014; privately made, untraceable firearms &#x2014; the Board requested that the County Counsel prepare two ordinances to regulate the possession, manufacturing, sale and\/or assembly of privately manufactured firearms.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Gun violence took the lives of nearly 1,500 Santa Clara County residents between 2001 and 2020, costing Santa Clara County

href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/04\/20\/womens-golf-ties-for-second-at-pac-12-championships\/\">win<\/a> the Pac-12 title by seven strokes. Stanford, the No. 1&#x2013;ranked team in the country and the overwhelming favorite, would have to patiently wait for a chance at another championship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Tuesday, the opportunity came Stanford&#x2019;s way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By defeating No. 8 Georgia in the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/05\/25\/survive-and-advance-womens-golf-heads-to-ncaa-final\/\">quarterfinals<\/a> and No. 5 Auburn in the semifinals on Monday, the Cardinal advanced to the championship match. As fate would have it, Stanford faced a familiar foe in the final: the Oregon Ducks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This time around, the Cardinal could not be stopped. With consistent ball-striking and clutch putting, Stanford defeated Oregon 3-2 to win its second-ever NCAA Championship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;It feels incredible,&#x201D; head coach Anne Walker told <a href=\"https:\/\/gostanford.com\/news\/2022\/5\/25\/womens-golf-simply-dominant.aspx\">GoStanford<\/a>. &#x201C;It takes really special people [to win with expectations], to be able to shut that noise out and be able to come out here and perform and allow yourself to swing free the way they did today.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As in the quarterfinals and semifinals, the championship featured a best-of-five match-play format &#x2014; the first team to secure three match-play victories would win the NCAA title.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cardinal got off to a fast start against Oregon, jumping out to early leads in three of five matches.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the opening match, junior Brooke Seay took a commanding lead over Oregon&#x2019;s Ching-Tzu Chen. After the two tied the first three holes with pars, Seay won the fourth, fifth and seventh holes to take a 3-up lead. She added to her advantage with two more wins on the 11th and 12th holes and ultimately prevailed 4&amp;3 to give Stanford its first point of the afternoon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seay credited her success to an even-keeled approach throughout the tournament.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Staying really patient and staying committed to every shot and leaving everything out there,&#x201D; Seay said to Golf Channel after her match. &#x201C;Really just focused on fairways and greens and being in the right place.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The win concluded a memorable week for Seay, in which she won the Elite 90 award for her academic performance, made a hole-in-one and was one of just two Stanford golfers to go undefeated in match play.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second match of the day, senior Aline Krauter faced off against the Ducks&#x2019; Cynthia Lu. Krauter, who won the 2020 Women&#x2019;s Amateur Championship, has earned a reputation as a formidable match-play opponent &#x2014; and against Lu, she dominated the whole way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Krauter&#x2019;s 5&amp;3 victory over Lu secured an undefeated match-play performance for the senior. More importantly, though, the win put Stanford one point away from an NCAA Championship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Down 2-0 and on their last legs, the Ducks would not go down without a fight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In match number four, Oregon&#x2019;s Tze-Han Lin battled sophomore Rachel Heck. Heck, last year&#x2019;s NCAA individual champion, struggled on the greens against Lin, missing several short putts. Nevertheless, she hung in the contest and was only 1-down after 12 holes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, Heck almost aced the par-3 from, lipping out from 149 yards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/StanfordWGolf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@StanfordWGolf<\/a>&#39;s Rachel Heck came as close to an ace as you can possibly get. &#x1F605;<br><br>&#x1F4FA; Golf Channel | <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Stifel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Stifel<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/mwSV4rjvdt\">pic.twitter.com\/mwSV4rjvdt<\/a><\/p>&mdash; Golf Channel (@GolfChannel) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/GolfChannel\/status\/1529615298336370688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 26, 2022<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The near ace could have been the turning point in Heck&#x2019;s match, but Lin would not concede the hole so easily. She also found the green with her tee shot and poured in a lengthy birdie putt to tie the hole.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From that point forward, Lin controlled the match. She won the next two holes and stuffed her approach close at the par-3 16th to all but guarantee a birdie. Heck conceded her putt, and Lin won 3&amp;2, narrowing Stanford&#x2019;s lead to 2-1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the third match, sophomore Sadie Englemann had a chance to clinch the national title for Stanford. After a close front nine, she managed to take a 2-up lead over Oregon&#x2019;s Briana Chacon on the 14th hole.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Down two holes with four to play, Chacon demonstrated why she won the Albuquerque Regional just two weeks ago. She made a clutch birdie on the 15th to get within one of Englemann, and on the 17th, she tied the match up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heading to the 18th hole, Chacon needed a win to keep Oregon&#x2019;s title hopes alive, and she executed &#x2014; playing a masterful bunker shot and making the ensuing birdie putt to beat Englemann 1-up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the overall score now tied at 2-2, it all came down to the final match between freshman Rose Zhang and Oregon&#x2019;s Sofie Kibsgaard Nielsen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still riding the momentum from her NCAA individual championship win two days ago, Zhang took a 3-up over Nielsen lead heading to the back nine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even so, Nielsen, like the rest of the Oregon team, would not go down easily. She won the 12th hole and then birdied the 14th to get within one of Zhang.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever the competitor, Zhang responded to Nielsen&#x2019;s advances by sticking her approach shot close on the 15th hole. She made the birdie to increase her lead back to two holes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her lead remained at two as the match moved to the 17th. At this point, Zhang needed to tie only one more hole to win the match and secure the title for Stanford.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zhang teed off first on the par-4, hitting an iron shot into the thick rough right of the fairway. Nielsen followed, and her ball went in the same direction, coming to rest in the right rough 20 yards behind Zhang&#x2019;s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Nielsen was further away, she hit her approach shot first. Her approach landed on the green but caught a slope and rolled back onto the fairway. Focused on her next shot, she walked briskly toward the green.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was during this seemingly unimportant walk that Nielsen made a costly error: she accidentally rolled over Zhang&#x2019;s golf ball with her push cart. In match play, contact with an opponent&#x2019;s golf ball, even if accidental, incurs a one-stroke penalty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The penalty all but secured the victory for Zhang and Stanford. With Nielsen lying three short of the green, Zhang could take three putts and still win the NCAA Championship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And she only needed two.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">LET&#x2019;S GO!!!!!!!!! <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/FGchNtYqIu\">pic.twitter.com\/FGchNtYqIu<\/a><\/p>&mdash; Stanford Women&#39;s Golf (@StanfordWGolf) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/StanfordWGolf\/status\/1529631903266922496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 26, 2022<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In fitting fashion, Zhang stroked her five-foot par putt into the center of the cup to give Stanford the win. When the ball found the hole, her teammates rushed the green to congratulate her, screaming and crying tears of joy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;It speaks to the caliber of player that they are, but it also speaks to the type of people that they are,&#x201D; Walker said of the win. &#x201C;They really desired that &#x2014; they wanted that for each other. I think that fueled them to be able to do it more readily.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stanford&#x2019;s NCAA win caps off what has been a dominant season for the team from start to finish. Coming into the year with sky-high expectations, the Cardinal met or exceeded them all, winning six tournaments as a team and maintaining their No. 1 ranking throughout the season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the team success took precedence &#x2014; all season long, Walker espoused a team-first mentality &#x2014; the year was also filled with inspiring individual performances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zhang, the No. 1&#x2013;ranked amateur in the world, began her collegiate career by doing something not even Tiger Woods had accomplished: winning each of her first three starts. This week, her talent was on full display, as she took the NCAA individual title at six-under-par and won the Annika Award, which is presented to the top college golfer in the country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heck followed up her dominant freshman season with another strong campaign. She won individually at both the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/02\/15\/heck-wins-medalist-honors-womens-golf-finishes-runner-up-at-lamkin-invitational\/\">Lamkin Invitational<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/03\/01\/womens-golf-sets-ncaa-record-at-gunrock-invitational\/\">Gunrock Invitational<\/a> to pick up her seventh and eighth career wins, respectively. She now sits in second on Stanford&#x2019;s all-time wins list, one behind Andrea Lee &#x2019;20.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The season also saw the re-emergence of veterans Krauter and Seay, both of whom made Stanford&#x2019;s national championship possible. Krauter was the Cardinal&#x2019;s rock, finishing in the top 16 in every event she competed in before NCAAs. Seay registered five consecutive top-eight finishes during a stretch from November to May.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With several strong performances from Englemann, freshman Caroline Sturdza, junior Angelina Ye and many others, it was Stanford&#x2019;s depth that allowed them to flourish. On any given day, each player in Stanford&#x2019;s lineup could break par and propel the team to victory.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The NCAA Championship is Stanford&#x2019;s third this academic year, after men&#x2019;s gymnastics&#x2019; win in April and women&#x2019;s water polo&#x2019;s triumph earlier this May. It&#x2019;s Stanford&#x2019;s 131st NCAA title overall and the second in the women&#x2019;s golf program&#x2019;s history.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the women&#x2019;s golf team roster only features two seniors, the Cardinal will be in prime position to contend for another championship next season.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With consistent ball-striking and clutch putting, No. 1 overall seed Stanford women&#8217;s golf defeated No. 2 Oregon 3-2 to win its second-ever NCAA title on Tuesday. &#8220;It feels incredible,&#8221;
