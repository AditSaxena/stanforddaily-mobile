The felony of sexual battery, which Giacomini pleaded guilty to earlier this year, took place at the Veterans Affairs (VA) Hospital in Palo Alto. Several former colleagues from Stanford and the Palo Alto VA advocated for Giacomini&#x2019;s character in letters of support to the court, prior to his sentencing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giacomini led the cardiology department of the Palo Alto VA from 1985 to 2018. He also directed the Stanford Cardiology Fellowship and served as a Stanford Medicine faculty member. He <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/05\/15\/former-stanford-medicine-faculty-member-indicted-for-alleged-sexual-battery-at-palo-alto-va\/\">lost<\/a> those positions in 2018 when the accusations of sexual violence emerged. Stanford Medicine placed Giacomini on leave in June 2018 when they learned of the complaint, wrote Julie Greicius, a Stanford Healthcare spokesperson, in a statement to The Daily. Giacomini &#x201C;permanently left Stanford shortly thereafter, when the investigation resulted in grounds to terminate his contract,&#x201D; Greicius wrote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The case was referred to the U.S. Attorney&#x2019;s Office by the Department of Veterans Affairs because it occurred on federal property at the Palo Alto VA. Giacomini was <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/05\/15\/former-stanford-medicine-faculty-member-indicted-for-alleged-sexual-battery-at-palo-alto-va\/\">indicted<\/a> in 2020 by a federal grand jury and later pleaded guilty in March of this year, three days before his trial was set to begin. On Tuesday, Judge Freeman sentenced Giacomini to pay a fine of $15,000, undergo a special assessment and serve one year of supervised release in addition to his prison term.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The victim <a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/usao-ndca\/pr\/former-chief-cardiology-palo-alto-va-hospital-sentenced-prison-sexual-battery\">told<\/a> the court that &#x201C;the primary reason I reported these events was to help prevent this from happening to anyone else again, especially women fellows in the field of cardiology,&#x201D; during the sentencing. Giacomini began his unsolicited sexual contact with one of the victims in the fall of 2017. They resigned at the end of that year, following multiple instances of sexual harassment and abuse.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His attorney requested a more lenient sentence &#x2014; home confinement instead of prison &#x2014; in light of the letters of support and Giacomini&#x2019;s age and health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paul Yock, a current Stanford Medicine faculty member and the founding director of the Byers Center for Biodesign, wrote in a letter of support that he did &#x201C;not have any direct knowledge of the issues leading to [Giacomini&#8217;s] recent legal issues.&#x201D;&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yock concluded the letter by emphasizing his personal and professional admiration of Giacomini and respect for &#x201C;his deep commitment both to his clinical practice and to the training of young physicians and scientists.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x200B;&#x200B;Current Stanford Medicine faculty members Todd J. Brinton and Thomas Rando, as well as former faculty members Maurice Buchbinder and Michael Pham, submitted letters in support of Giacomini. Connor O&#x2019;Brien, Laura Dodera, William L. Bennett,&#xA0;Judy Baer, Tanta Blodget, Cheryl Leppi and Svetlana Gorbunova were also among the former colleagues who submitted letters in support of Giacomini.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony Brass, Giacomini&#x2019;s attorney, said he was &#x201C;grateful for the letters,&#8221; adding that &#x201C;the letters were speaking to the human side of the doctor, but were not on the subject of guilt and innocence as he had already accepted full responsibility.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The prosecutors wrote in their sentencing memorandum, a partially-redacted copy of which was obtained by The Daily, that &#x201C;sexual abuse is a crime of power. Abusers use their power to intimidate, molest, and silence the victim &#x2014; usually in that order.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The memo cites a witness &#x201C;who believed that Dr. Giacomini and his supporters retaliated against her professionally after she rebuffed his attempts to pursue a romantic relationship with her.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Referencing the letters of support, the prosecutors wrote that &#x201C;a cursory review of Dr. Giacomini&#x2019;s many letters of support conveys his power and prestige within the profession.&#x201D; According to the prosecutors, &#x201C;this power differential between Dr. Giacomini and Victim was an extremely aggravating factor severely undermining any pretense of her consent to his sexual advances.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The letters from his colleagues do not explicitly discuss an appropriate sentence but emphasize their positive view of his character and professional accomplishments.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stanford law professor and survivor advocate Michele Dauber wrote that &#x201C;it is disturbing and shocking to realize that the victim has read these letters and knows that her fellow physicians stood with the abuser and not with her,&#x201D; in a statement to The Daily. &#x201C;His conviction for his crimes directly contradicts any notion that he was a good mentor,&#x201D; she wrote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dauber wrote that Giacomini&#x2019;s conviction was indicative of widespread issues at the university, pointing to the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/06\/10\/destroyed-my-career-faculty-report-unchecked-sexual-harassment-in-school-of-medicine\/\">series<\/a> of allegations made by female faculty at the Stanford School of Medicine regarding &#x201C;unchecked sexual harassment.&#x201D; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stanford Medicine has zero tolerance for sexual harassment, Greicius added, and there are &#x201C;robust policies in place to address these matters.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;If any of our faculty, staff or students is experiencing or has experienced harassment or discrimination in our community, we want to hear from them,&#x201D; Greicius wrote.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article has been updated to include comment from Stanford Medicine.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A previous version of this story inaccurately attributed a quote to Michele Dauber. That quote has been removed. The Daily regrets this error.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Despite considerable support from former colleagues, former Stanford faculty member John Giacomini was

Levine, Assistant Secretary for Health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to reflect on her experiences combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Levine was nominated by the Biden Administration in February, 2021 and was <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/03\/24\/us\/politics\/rachel-levine-transgender-senate.html\"><em>confirmed<\/em><\/a><em> in March. During this year&#x2019;s Pride Month, Levine &#x2014; the first openly transgender official confirmed by the Senate &#x2014; <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DFRKDT3Px_E&amp;t=2938s\"><em>spoke<\/em><\/a><em> to the Stanford Department of Pediatrics about the pediatric disparities and unequal opportunities that LGBTQ+ youth face. On June 11, she also attended the 35th anniversary display of the AIDS Memorial Quilt at San Francisco&#x2019;s Golden Gate Park, recounting the deaths inflicted by the AIDS\/HIV epidemic that she witnessed firsthand as a pediatrician in 1983.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Stanford Daily [TSD]: What are some lessons that you learned from handling the COVID-19 pandemic?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rachel L. Levine [RL]:<\/strong>&nbsp; I think that there are some clear lessons. One of them is that we are truly all interconnected. Literally, the decisions that each one of us make about our health, whether that&#8217;s to get tested or to get vaccinated, impact not only ourselves, but they impact our communities, our families. They impact our nation and they literally impact the world. We are all truly interconnected in so many ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another lesson of the pandemic is the importance of public health. And public health sometimes gets lost in the general medical structure that we have in our medical health systems. But public health at the local, state, federal and international level is really critical for the health of our world and our nation and critical to our response to this pandemic. I used to say that cities like San Francisco were the center of the universe, but actually public health is the center of our universe. It&#8217;s that important.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TSD: What is the importance of community-based organizations to expand health access to minority groups?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RL:<\/strong> Health equity is so critical to our work in public health. And of course, I&#8217;m at the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), where our secretary Xavier Becerra&#x2019;s priority is that we embed health equity into all of our different work. Health equity has to be the foundation. We can work on that federally, but actually, I think that some of the most important work is community work. I&#8217;ll come and visit your community, but I&#8217;m not there day by day.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, community health workers, advocates and health and medical workers really are the frontlines on how we bring health equity to many vulnerable, marginalized populations. That, of course, includes the African American community, the Latino community, the American Indian Native Alaskan community, the AAPI (Asian American Pacific Islander) community and our LGBTQI+ community &#x2014; there are so many intersections among those communities. So we really appreciate and depend on community health workers, community organizers and stakeholders to do that work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2847\" height=\"2139\" src=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Image-from-iOS-1-1.jpg?w=800\" alt=\"Levine gives a speech from a stage.

Long COVID is going to be one of the medical challenges of our future&nbsp;&#x2014; our present and our future. The president recognizes that, and he has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefing-room\/presidential-actions\/2022\/04\/05\/memorandum-on-addressing-the-long-term-effects-of-covid-19\/\">issued<\/a> a presidential memorandum asking for two reports, one on the supports and services for patients who have long COVID and the other the National Research Action Plan on Long COVID. My office is coordinating the writing of those reports. We are the lead. I want to acknowledge so many people across the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and across the administration that are contributing to that report. We need to involve the entire medical community and our primary care doctors in that long COVID work. And then we need to work on the research agenda which is being led by NIH and CDC, such as the <a href=\"https:\/\/recovercovid.org\">RECOVER<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.covidinspire.org\">INSPIRE<\/a> grants, and across the HHS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to acknowledge specifically the work from the VA and the Department of Defense, both on their research as well as their works in terms of supports and services. And we&#8217;re going to develop that action plan. Now, the reports are the beginning: we don&#8217;t write the report and go to bed. That is the roadmap to these living documents and this living plan about how we&#8217;re going to help people with long COVID. I think you need to take the lessons learned from the HIV epidemic and from COVID-19 itself. We will also develop these programs by taking the lessons we&#8217;ve learned dealing with chronic illnesses like ME\/CFS (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis\/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) and Lyme disease. So that is going to be one of the things that I&#8217;m going to concentrate on during my time at HHS.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In an interview with The Stanford Daily,

She says she&#8217;s still waiting for justice."},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p><em>This story contains references to sexual misconduct and assault that may be troubling to some readers. The student&#8217;s name has been changed out of respect for her privacy.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first time it happened, they had been dating for four months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;He stuck himself inside of me and raped me,&#x201D; she remembered, pausing to find the right words to recount the painful experience. &#x201C;I cried for the entire night. We had a big discussion about it, which boiled down to, &#x2018;What you did wasn&#x2019;t okay. You knew that I didn&#x2019;t ever want to do this; why did you?&#x2019;&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura told The Daily<strong> <\/strong>that her ex-boyfriend raped her several times over the course of eight months. She had made it clear to him before that she wanted to wait to have sex, and in a conversation after the first time, she reiterated that she did not want to have sex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there was a second time &#x2014; after one of his fraternity&#x2019;s special dinners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost immediately, Laura added, &#x201C;He drank a little bit, and I drank a little bit, but we weren&#8217;t drunk at all.&#x201D; Her remark preempted the type of <a href=\"https:\/\/jacksonhealth.org\/support-sexual-assault-victims-stop-victim-blaming\/\">questioning<\/a> people who have experienced sexual violence can face when coming forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They had another discussion after he raped her again, and this time, he cried. He cried because, as she put it, &#x201C;he raped me, and he knew it.&#x201D; She then had to spend the night comforting her assaulter, she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Laura wasn&#x2019;t in a position to break up with him. She knew her parents would pull her out of Stanford if they found out what had happened &#x2014; she said that at the time, she was at a vulnerable point in her Stanford career and was also living with her boyfriend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the second assault, she told him they could have sex &#x2014; but only if he wore a condom. Yet often, he refused to wear one. After another big argument about it, they stopped having sex altogether. About a month later, they ended their year-long relationship in January 2020. Soon, COVID-19 lockdown started, and Laura didn&#x2019;t have to see him at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Laura returned to campus for spring quarter 2021 in-person, she said she saw her assaulter everywhere.<strong> <\/strong>His presence distressed her, and she wanted him off campus &#x2014; not necessarily out of school, but away from campus spaces and away from her. In an effort to see that hope through, she would spend her next months navigating the ins and outs of Stanford&#x2019;s Title IX process &#x2014; only to find herself lost in a process in which she said she lacked agency, autonomy and knowledge of what was going on.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Seeking justice<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>About two weeks before the 2021-22 school year began, Laura reached out to the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2021\/10\/27\/stanfords-current-title-ix-policies-explained\/\">Stanford Title IX Office<\/a> and opened a case. In accordance with the <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/20200814-Title-IX-Procedure.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">University&#x2019;s Title IX procedure<\/a>, she said that they presented her with two options: enter a formal process, or sign an informal resolution. The <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/08\/04\/stanfords-draft-title-ix-procedures-explained\/\">formal process<\/a> procedure involves an external group investigating the case to determine whether to proceed to a hearing, during which the evidence is reviewed. An informal resolution involves the parties engaging in mediation with the help of an outside party and coming together to reach a mutual agreement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura chose to go the route of an informal resolution. She said she viewed this process as providing &#x201C;an adequate environment for [her] to heal and grow&#x201D; while &#x201C;additionally [allowing] the respondent to avoid harsher consequences for his actions.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Oct. 7, both parties signed an informal resolution, which was provided to The Daily. The resolution required the respondent to move off-campus, barred him from coming to campus unless academically necessary, prohibited him from attending Stanford-affiliated events (both on and off campus) and required him to disaffiliate from his fraternity. The respondent remained enrolled at Stanford. Following the informal resolution, The Title IX Office closed Laura&#x2019;s case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Laura would soon find that the respondent seldom followed the requirements of the informal resolution.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fourteen days later, the respondent violated the resolution terms for the first time when he attended a Stanford Women&#8217;s Soccer game. Email correspondence obtained by The Daily indicates that Title IX Coordinator and Director of the Sexual Harassment\/Assault Response &amp; Education Office (SHARE) Stephen Chen confirmed the incident with Laura&#x2019;s mother, in whom Laura ultimately confided, over a month after the violation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of the violation, Laura reached out to Chen to express concern about the respondent&#x2019;s presence on campus, including by sharing that she had been informed that the respondent was still a member of his fraternity and living in its house, according to the emails. She expressed her confusion to Chen, explaining that the Title IX Office had informed her that the respondent had moved off campus the day before the game. In his response, Chen answered with an explanation of how the respondent&#x2019;s plans for getting off campus had fallen through: he now planned to move out the following Monday, five days after he was originally supposed to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I hope that helps explain his presence on campus beyond what we were told,&#x201D; Chen wrote in an email to Laura on Oct. 23.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura&#x2019;s difficulties navigating the Title IX process are backdropped by Stanford&#x2019;s nearly two-in-five sexual violence rate for undergraduate women over the course of their academic career and what many see as an already fragmented relationship between people who have experienced sexual violence and the University. The sexual violence rate was determined by a 2019 Association of American Universities <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/AAU-2019-Survey-Stanford-Report-Summary.pdf\" data-type=\"URL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">survey<\/a>, which also found that 56% of Stanford students believe that campus officials wouldn&#x2019;t conduct a fair investigation &#x2014; the percentage is 71% for undergraduate women and 81% for transgender, genderqueer, nonbinary or otherwise gender nonconforming (TGQN) members of the Stanford community. The survey also found that 52% of undergraduate women and 61% of TGQN members of the community believe that campus officials wouldn&#x2019;t take the report seriously.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the University declined to comment on Laura&#x2019;s case for confidentiality reasons, Student Affairs spokesperson Pat Harris wrote in a statement to The Daily that Stanford encourages those who have experienced sexual harassment to contact the Title IX Office.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Stanford&#x2019;s priority when contacted by a student with a Title IX concern is to assess any affected student&#x2019;s safety and well-being,&#x201D; Harris wrote. &#x201C;The University is dedicated to responding quickly, appropriately, in a caring manner and in accordance with the circumstances presented.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to confidential counseling through the <a href=\"https:\/\/vaden.stanford.edu\/confidential-support-team-cst\">Confidential Support Team<\/a> (CST) and<a href=\"https:\/\/yourywca.stanford.edu\/\"> YWCA at Stanford<\/a>, students may also receive academic accommodations and campus escort services, Harris wrote. She also mentioned the potential for mutual restrictions on contact between the parties, changes in work or housing locations, leaves of absence and increased security and monitoring of certain campus areas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for Laura, the University&#x2019;s institutional support was lacking: she turned to others for help, including the resident assistants (RAs) at the respondent&#x2019;s fraternity, as the respondent continued to violate the terms of the informal agreement by returning to campus, she said.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Correspondence between Laura and two RAs shows several discussions between the three in which they tried to identify avenues of support. While one RA said that a conversation with the Title IX Office clarified that they could not get involved with the case for privacy and legal reasons, the RAs expressed to Laura that they still wanted to support her however they could. Often, she would turn to the RAs to ask whether the respondent had been seen on campus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, one of the RAs, who spoke with The Daily on the condition of anonymity for fear of university retribution, said that in general, RAs are inadequately trained to address issues related to sexual assault. He said that while they have been directed to reach out to the Title IX Office in the event of an incident, communication between RAs and the Title IX Office has historically been sparse. He added that they often have to reach out to the Title IX Office multiple times to receive a response.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;There&#8217;s a disconnect between what the office sees is necessary when it comes to reaching out and what is actually necessary in practice; communication has not been strong with RAs around even closed cases,&#x201D; he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chen did not respond to a request for comment on communication between RAs and the Title IX Office.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Unenforced resolution<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout fall and winter quarter of the 2021-22 school year, Laura continued to receive reports from friends warning her that they had seen the respondent on campus, leaving her feeling unsafe. She navigated campus in fear of seeing the respondent; at one point, she asked RAs at the respondent&#x2019;s fraternity if she needed to avoid the fraternity house because of the possibility of encountering him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this time, enforcement of the informal resolution seemed to fall on Laura and her mother, who found themselves consistently notifying Chen of the reported violations. Correspondence between Laura&#x2019;s mother and Chen shows that Chen did not share any actions that the Title IX Office was planning to take. The suggestions he did provide to get the respondent off campus placed the burden on Laura and her mother. Chen said they could file a complaint about his presence on campus in violation of a university directive, but specified that it could &#8220;take months to resolve.&#8221; He added that they could also ask the Stanford Department of Public Safety to request that he be escorted off campus, but later said that they would &#x201C;need to get an official stay away order from [the] General Counsel&#x2019;s office before the police [would] actually remove [the respondent] from campus.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After he had verified the respondent&#x2019;s first violation, Chen wrote in an email to Laura&#x2019;s mom that &#x201C;it&#x2019;s also important to note that that was almost two months ago, and he&#x2019;s been on the East coast for most of the time since then.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first weekend of December, one of Laura&#x2019;s friends told Laura that they had seen the respondent at the Row house where his girlfriend lived. Chen explained that he had allowed the respondent to come back to campus for a non-academic reason to retrieve some of his belongings, a visit that would have been a violation of the informal resolution. However, he didn&#x2019;t inform Laura until after the respondent had already arrived on campus and said he couldn&#x2019;t explain the respondent&#x2019;s presence at another residence. Laura also didn&#x2019;t understand why Chen let the respondent back on campus in the first place: he could&#x2019;ve just as easily gotten somebody to get his belongings and bring them to him, she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Chen ultimately told Laura&#x2019;s mom that the Title IX Office could request a stay away order, he added that the order likely wouldn&#x2019;t be completed in the next few hours and by then, the respondent would have already left campus. He did not discuss the order&#x2019;s potential implications for future breaches.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Referring to this particular violation and Chen&#x2019;s response, Laura wrote, &#x201C;[Chen] didn&#8217;t care that the respondent was on campus and was (seemingly) mad that I was having friends tell me to stay away from certain areas so I didn&#8217;t run into my assaulter.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said she felt helpless every time she brought up a violation to the Title IX Office, only to be met with unclear answers that left her still wondering how the office was going to enforce the resolution. &#x201C;I [wanted the Title IX Office] to do more things to punish [the respondent] or basically incentivize him to stop coming to campus and stop breaking these terms that he signed,&#x201D; she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/20200814-Title-IX-Procedure.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stanford&#x2019;s Title IX Procedure<\/a> outlines the process of coming to an informal resolution, it does not include information on how such resolutions are enforced. Chen did not respond to The Daily&#x2019;s request for comment on the incident or on what pathways exist for complainants when a respondent violates the terms of an informal resolution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Law professor Michele Dauber, who declined to comment on a specific student matter, wrote in an email to The Daily that she has &#x201C;long had concerns about whether informal resolutions sufficiently protect survivors.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;In my view it is essential that Stanford&#8217;s processes are clear and transparent so that survivors know how an informal resolution will be enforced before they agree to it,&#x201D; Dauber wrote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dauber also stressed the importance of investigating alleged violations of informal resolutions and adjudicating them swiftly and in ways that &#x201C;protect the rights of survivors&#x201D;. She suggested that the University take measures such as &#x201C;ensuring that all decision makers are trauma informed, utilizing the preponderance of the evidence as the burden of proof and providing needed legal assistance and other supports and accommodations.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Midway through winter quarter, Laura said, the Title IX Office began the process of formally charging the respondent for violating the informal resolution. However, they informed her that her case was being passed to the Office of Community Standards (OCS), where it took a new form as a case regarding a breach of a <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/20200814-Title-IX-Procedure.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">university directive<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura explained that her frustration grew when her case got handed to OCS. &#x201C;Every single time that I would ask for updates, [the Title IX Office] would say we don&#8217;t know because we&#8217;re not a part of that office,&#x201D; she said, explaining that she was no longer the complainant in the case &#x2014; the Title IX Office was.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because she wasn&#x2019;t the complainant, Laura said that she couldn&#x2019;t submit evidence or control anything about the case. She feared that she wouldn&#x2019;t get the opportunity to advocate for herself.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked to clarify policies surrounding complainants in OCS cases, Harris wrote that &#x201C;others harmed by the alleged behavior can request to become a co-complainant in an OCS concern, thereby securing all the responsibilities and privileges of a complainant.&#x201D; She added that all parties are afforded rights in accordance with <a href=\"https:\/\/archive.ph\/K80u3\">Stanford&#x2019;s Student Judicial Charter of 1997<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an email to The Daily on behalf of Harris, Jennifer Calvert, Student Affairs Chief of Staff, explained that individuals or groups wishing to become co-complainants should make that request directly to OCS. However, this option is not specifically outlined in either the Student Judicial Charter or the <a href=\"https:\/\/communitystandards.stanford.edu\/\">OCS website<\/a> as of the date of publication.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An OCS process may involve one reporting party or multiple reporting parties. The party that files a concern with OCS is considered the Reporting Party. If another individual (or individuals) wishes to become a Reporting Party in the same incident of reported conduct, then they can make that request directly to OCS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The respondent was also slated to graduate in winter 2022, and the informal resolution terms were set to expire upon his graduation &#x2014; &#x201C;not that they really did anything,&#x201D; Laura said. Currently, Laura said, the respondent is not listed under Stanford&#8217;s student profiles, however it is unclear if that indicates he is no longer at the University.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The University did not clarify whether not having a student profile indicates that the respondent is no longer a student.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Finding safety<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As of now, Laura said she has not been informed of any result from the OCS case. In the meantime, she is seeking a permanent restraining order from the county, which can last between three and five years, citing inadequate protection from the University. Her trial is set for later this month. Until then, a temporary restraining order (TRO) that Laura got in late February (and extended in late March) will remain in place, requiring the respondent to stay off of the Stanford campus and at least 300 yards away from her at all times. Laura said that since the TRO went into effect during winter quarter, the respondent has stopped violating the informal resolution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I finally feel safe on campus,&#x201D; she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura will be representing herself in her trial for the permanent restraining order, as she did in February and March for the temporary order. The respondent, however, has retained a lawyer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Stanford provides <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/20200814-Title-IX-Procedure.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">legal resources<\/a> for Title IX procedures, Laura no longer has access to them because her Title IX case is closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harris wrote that the University&#x2019;s &#x201C;professional staff remain in close contact and accessible to students throughout the Title IX and any related processes, including any hearings and discussions regarding informal resolutions, and continue to offer supportive measures as needed.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In late March, Stanford Title IX attorney Susan Stark, who represented the respondent during the Title IX process, informed Chen of the respondent&#x2019;s intent to file a concern with OCS, saying that Laura&#x2019;s filing of a restraining order is a violation of the informal resolution, which states that &#x201C;both parties will not have any further contact with one another and agree not to pursue any further formal actions related to incidents arising from their past relationship.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In email correspondence reviewed by The Daily, Chen explained to Laura that the respondent would be willing to withdraw the OCS case if Laura stopped pursuing a restraining order and was open to modifying the informal resolution to apply even after he graduates. &#x201C;The practical effect would be similar to a restraining order,&#x201D; Chen wrote. He added that &#x201C;the respondent is taking the informal resolution more seriously, so there may be reason to believe that he would abide by the terms going forward,&#x201D; though he did not elaborate on any observed behavior that led to this belief.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura, however, decided to continue pursuing the restraining order.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In early April, Chen informed all parties involved over email that they would communicate directly with OCS going forward, instead of the Title IX Office. Since then, Laura hasn&#x2019;t heard anything about the OCS complaint, concluding that it is likely the respondent didn&#x2019;t pursue it. But, she said it was clear that he and Stark wanted to discourage her from pursuing the restraining order by threatening a complaint.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stark did not respond to The Daily&#x2019;s request for comment regarding her involvement in the case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>&#x2018;I should have just done the formal process&#x2019;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Had I known [all this would happen], I would have just gone through the formal process,&#x201D; Laura said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She chose to go with an informal resolution because she wanted to resolve the case quickly. But despite choosing the informal route, her process has already spanned over ten months. &#x201C;I should have just done the formal process. That might have gotten me a better outcome,&#x201D; she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Laura said that a recent conversation with Chen has given her the impression that the Title IX Office is looking into making changes to their informal resolution policies as a result of her case (Chen did not respond to The Daily&#x2019;s request for comment on such developments), Laura remains concerned that others seeking justice through the Title IX Office will have to go through a similar ordeal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She recommended that students who have experienced sexual violence reach out to the <a href=\"https:\/\/yourywca.stanford.edu\/\">YWCA<\/a> at Stanford, a program of YWCA Golden Gate Silicon Valley that <a href=\"https:\/\/yourywca.stanford.edu\/\">provides<\/a> &#x201C;confidential support to survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence, human trafficking, stalking, and sexual harassment.&#x201D; Lindsey Mansfield, the Director of Support Services at YWCA Golden Gate Silicon Valley, explained that the YWCA team connects with survivors to help them determine the best resources for their situation. &#x201C;Each resource or course of action we discuss is guided by what the individual wants to focus on,&#x201D; she wrote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those seeking legal recourse, Mansfield said the YWCA recommends the <a href=\"https:\/\/assu.stanford.edu\/services\/legal-counsel-office\">Associated Students of Stanford Legal Counsel Office<\/a>. For off-campus support, they often refer survivors to the Santa Clara County <a href=\"https:\/\/countyda.sccgov.org\/victim-services\/family-justice-centers\">Family Justice Centers<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scscourt.org\/self_help.shtml\">Self-Help Center<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For individuals who want to remain anonymous, the YWCA recommends the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rainn.org\/resources\">Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network<\/a> hotline numbers and online chatting, according to Mansfield.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another resource available to members of the Stanford community includes Sexual Assault Response Team (SART) <a href=\"https:\/\/archive.ph\/MbFvK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">testing<\/a>, which is available at Stanford Hospital.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I just hope that other survivors are more aware of the failings of the Title IX process and are able to make a better-informed decision,&#x201D; Laura said.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Months after a Stanford student brought her case of sexual misconduct to the Stanford Title IX office, her assaulter continued to violate the terms of their signed agreement, she said.

Decades. All that wealth &#x2014; and for what? Truly a waste. You have no excuse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the way, when I address &#x201C;Stanford&#x201D; here, I am addressing those in positions of power and authority. The more power you have, and the more you are being paid, the more accountable you are to your community and for Stanford&#x2019;s failures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: In 2000, you let your &#x201C;star&#x201D; faculty violate my 22-year-old self. That&#x2019;s how my career began &#x2014; with violence I am still struggling to comprehend. I was so naive and inexperienced I was confused by what was happening. I &#x2014;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: Now you&#x2019;re <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/19\/a-stanford-professor-sexually-harassed-his-student-a-decade-ago-some-female-students-say-his-inappropriate-behavior-never-stopped\/\">sending your rape culture to CUNY<\/a> where I work and teach? How dare you! How dare you invade my home?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: This letter is repetitive because traumatic re-living is repetitive and you continue to resurrect those hideous memories by making headlines about rape culture on your campus.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: My parents sacrificed a lot to give me a life less chaotic and violent than theirs. They trusted you to keep their daughter safe from the &#x201C;bad&#x201D; behavior of serial abusers. Their trust was betrayed  &#x2014; not once, not twice, but over and over and over and over and over again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: CUNY is underfunded. You are overfunded. What is the correct way to redress such inequality? I don&#x2019;t know. I do know that letting your rape culture make contact with CUNY students is the wrong way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: Colleagues were &#8220;repeatedly asked to &#x2018;babysit&#x2019; Barletta&#8221;? In what universe is such infantilization of a serial abuser acceptable?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: You cannot possibly claim that you are &#x201C;helpless&#x201D; here, that you &#x201C;had no idea,&#x201D; that you are understaffed or under-resourced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: When I was a 22-year-old first-year Ph.D. student in your English Department, your &#x201C;star&#x201D; faculty raped and harassed me. I was unable, under such circumstances, to excel, to collaborate with colleagues (he isolated me), unable at times to work (I was too busy trying to avoid being raped), often unable to think at all. And my abuser did this to others at Stanford too. Not only did my abuser harm multiple students, but you continue to allow <a href=\"https:\/\/academic-sexual-misconduct-database.org\/incidents?query=stanford\">multiple people in positions of power and authority to harm generations of students and employees<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: How could you. How could you <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/news\/2008\/march12\/oldbooks-031208.html\">name that library in his honor<\/a> after you yourself punished him for what he did to me? He used one of those <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/SAAASA\/permalink\/5687106724695954\">books<\/a> to &#x2014; I won&#x2019;t finish this sentence. I won&#x2019;t go there. Not again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: You have squandered my patience and goodwill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/pr\/92\/920602Arc2192.html\">Archuleta<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/19\/a-stanford-professor-sexually-harassed-his-student-a-decade-ago-some-female-students-say-his-inappropriate-behavior-never-stopped\/\">Barletta<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/stanfordpolitics.org\/2017\/12\/03\/jay-fliegelman-sexual-misconduct\/\">Fliegelman<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2017\/11\/16\/harassment-assault-allegations-against-moretti-span-three-campuses\/\">Moretti<\/a> &#x2014; why? Just &#x2014; why?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: This is not how I want to be spending my summer. I was actually working on my book project when news about Vincent Barletta &#x201C;mentoring&#x201D; CUNY students reset my brain&#x2019;s time zone to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/PTSD?src=hashtag_click\">#PTSD<\/a>. For the past month, I&#x2019;ve been re-living the year 2000 (when your &#x201C;star&#x201D; faculty violated my 22-year-old self).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: Fuck you for <a href=\"https:\/\/stanfordmag.org\/contents\/remembering-jay-fliegelman\">covering up<\/a> the abuse and the punishment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: You are Victor Frankenstein and my suffering is the creature you made. Take responsibility for your creation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: I had just turned 22 years old.&nbsp; I was naive and inexperienced. I was a first-year graduate student, new to the profession, new to teaching, new to California, new to Stanford. He was tenured. He was powerful. He was in his 50s. <a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/pr\/2007\/pr-fliegelman-082207.html\">He had been a Stanford institution for decades<\/a>. This is disjointed because I&#8217;m reliving it all over again. Shortly after he violated me, I was hospitalized. Shortly after I was discharged from the hospital, I gave a <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn.kqed.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/10\/2017\/12\/Syllabus.jpg\">guest lecture on Seneca Falls and women&#x2019;s rights<\/a>. His response was to tell me I forgot to mention women&#8217;s right to sexual pleasure. There are gaps here because trauma is nonlinear, trauma broke my sense of time. At some point you conducted an investigation. As a <a href=\"https:\/\/academic-sexual-misconduct-database.org\/person\/jay-fliegelman\">result<\/a> of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.documentcloud.org\/documents\/4323656-Debra-Zumwalt-Letter-to-Seo-Young-Chu-11-27-2017.html\">the investigation<\/a>, which was a brutal experience, you punished my abuser by suspending him for two years without pay. Some of his colleagues had the gall to blame me for the whole debacle.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: By enabling rape culture and abuse to flourish, you promote hostile thinking environments. You poison ideas. You destroy minds. You weaken intellectual communities. You prevent work from happening.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: Every minute, hour, day, week, month, year, decade of your silence and inaction is disrupting my &#x201C;career,&#x201D; is relevant to my work, has shaped my sense of self as an academic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: I&#x2019;ve never sued you. I&#x2019;ve generously given you free feedback. I&#x2019;ve extended every deadline. I&#x2019;ve been more than patient with you. I&#x2019;ve spent countless hours <a href=\"https:\/\/asapjournal.com\/after-a-refuge-for-jae-in-doe-a-social-media-chronology\/\">educating you<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/asecsgradcaucus.wordpress.com\/2017\/11\/11\/asecs-executive-board-statement-on-harassment-and-abuse\/\">cleaning up your messes<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: By criticizing you I am not &#x201C;attacking&#x201D; your students, alumni, and workers. I am trying to make your campus better. Safer. More hospitable to learning. By speaking out like this I am trying to be a good alumna. I hope you are paying attention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: The truth is that my career started with rape. My career has been shaped by rape. My sense of who I am as an academic: shaped by rape. The gaps in my CV are trauma-generated plot holes that lead to Northern California in the year 2000.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: I&#x2019;m angry, I&#x2019;m disabled, I have work to do, I have a migraine. I want to lie down and shut my eyes and rest. But this is too important. I can&#x2019;t rest until CUNY is safe from your rape culture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: Have you even read &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/entropymag.org\/a-refuge-for-jae-in-doe-fugues-in-the-key-of-english-major\/\">A Refuge for Jae-in Doe<\/a>&#x201D;? The whole point of my sharing all that pain &#x2014; and in a language your English Department would understand: sonnets! The Western Canon! English (Major)! &#x2014; was to prevent more students from being harmed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: I am as &#x201C;proud&#x201D; to have a degree from your school as I would be &#x201C;proud&#x201D; to sport a blood diamond. Yes, the degree may glitter. But how much pain, injustice, conflict, humiliation, abuse, and violence does such glitter belie?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: I am ashamed to be associated with you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Stanford: If I were to write a book about your response to my requests for answers and answerability, most of the book&#x2019;s pages would be blank.

buildings on Stanford&#x2019;s main campus on Tuesday morning, according to an AlertSU notification. The source of the outage was <a href=\"https:\/\/emergency.stanford.edu\/\">identified<\/a> as a power line within the University&#x2019;s power infrastructure. The line provides power to the Green Library East Wing and the Coupa Cafe location adjacent to the library.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Power was <a href=\"https:\/\/police.stanford.edu\/alertsu.html?alertid=1343#top\">restored<\/a> in the afternoon to most other buildings affected, except Green Library East Wing and the Coupa Cafe, according to the latest update. Earlier in the day, 39 buildings were without power, four of which the University decided to temporarily close.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first Alert SU was issued at 6:54 a.m., notifying students of the partial outage. An update at 10:59 a.m stated that the outage was due to a malfunction within campus infrastructure, unlike the recent <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/24\/power-returns-to-campus-after-prolonged-outage\/\">PG&amp;E outage<\/a> in June when the Edgewood Park fire caused a PG&amp;E system failure and a two-day power outage across campus&#x200B;&#x200B;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buildings initially affected by the outage included the Knight Building, Arrillaga Alumni Center, Fire &amp; Police buildings, and Arrillaga Gym &amp; Weight Room, among others. No student residences lost power. The University provided a <a href=\"https:\/\/emergency.stanford.edu\/\">map<\/a> showing all of the locations affected by the outage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\"

Wing and adjacent cafe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>University spokesperson Luisa Rapport wrote that the cause of the outage is &#x201C;under investigation,&#x201D; in an email to The Daily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Any additional work or changes to the power system would depend on the cause of determination,&#x201D; Rapport wrote. &#x201C;Campus safety is a priority for university staff and is the first consideration, whether repairing, investigation or improving the power system.&#x201D;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A partial power outage led to the

the first time ever, I can relate to a superhero"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>I still remember how fun it was to watch the first Avengers film in theaters. Growing up immersed in the Marvel fandom, I found that the films never disappointed me &#x2014; the characters, scripts and cinematography were all simply brilliant. However, in spite of my love for Marvel, the characters often felt out of reach. The monsters, superheroes and action scenes all centered white American men in the United States, specifically in New York. I&#8217;m not complaining about the amusement &#x2014; I love NYC &#x2014; but why only there?<br><br>As a six-year-old turning the pages of colorful comics, I couldn&#x2019;t imagine scenarios in my head where I saved the Earth from evil without changing who I really was, because there was nobody like me on the Avengers team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marvel, like many Hollywood franchises, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.martlet.ca\/true-diversity-in-marvel-movies-is-lacking\/\">lacked<\/a> representation of marginalized communities for a long time. Much of Western media&#x2019;s depictions of Islam, especially after 9\/11, portrayed Muslims as either Middle Eastern terrorists who attack innocent people, narrow-minded men who control their families or women facing oppression under their own religion. These kinds of depictions in movies and television shows have fuelled a dangerous rise of <a href=\"https:\/\/news.gallup.com\/poll\/157082\/islamophobia-understanding-anti-muslim-sentiment-west.aspx\">Islamophobia<\/a> in the West.<br><br>Mistakenly, some people celebrate a scene as a groundbreaking example of representation when a non-white person comes on screen for not more than 5 minutes, says two or three lines and then never appears again. Representation needs to be more than that. We need to see characters that are played by actors who share their roots. We need films championing representation that have deeper storylines and showcase the characters&#x2019; cultures.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, Marvel has come a long way in &#x201C;Phase 4,&#x201D; or the films and shows covering the sequence of events after Avengers: Endgame. Its shows and movies now include depictions of diverse communities, <a href=\"https:\/\/movieweb.com\/moon-knight-representation-of-mental-illness\/\">mental illness<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/black-panther\/\">Black<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/arts-entertainment\/interactive\/2021\/shang-chi-asian-tropes\/\">Asian<\/a> culture and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chsglobe.com\/45290\/reviews\/lgbtq-representation-in-marvel\/\">LGBTQ+<\/a> individuals. And with Ms. Marvel, I finally saw myself reflected in a Marvel superhero.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Ms. Marvel&#x201D; is based on the 2014 solo comic book series by G. Willow Wilson and tells the story of Kamala Khan, also known as Ms. Marvel &#x2014; a 16-year-old Pakistani-American teenager from New Jersey with superpowers. Kamala, a comic book and Avengers nerd who struggles to fit in at both school and home, is Marvel&#x2019;s first-ever Muslim headliner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>19-year-old Canadian-Pakistani actress Iman Vellani is a perfect fit for the character. Hiring someone who actually shares the same roots as the character is very important for executing outstanding representation. Historically, in Hollywood, many Muslim and South-Asian characters have been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/entertainment\/movies\/la-et-mn-racial-erasure-essay-20160418-story.html\">played<\/a> by white people, which limits representation and makes it hard to embrace the authenticity of the characters. However, Marvel&#x2019;s casting of Vellani is one of the best portrayals so far.&nbsp; She brings both the colorful Muslim-South Asian side of her character and all the charm, passion, brilliance and awkwardness of a teenager to Kamala&#x2019;s character with ease. Considering that this is Vellani&#x2019;s first role ever on-screen, she does an amazing job and is sure to be a rising force in Hollywood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a Muslim teenager, &#x201C;Ms. Marvel&#x201D; means so much to me. Her superpowers grant her an air of strength, yet she is still a cheery, curious and nerdy teenager. She tries to navigate through life while having arguments with her parents, struggling to pay attention in school and trying to balance her social and religious commitments with her superhero dreams. In one scene that I particularly loved, Kamala schemes her way into attending AvengersCon with her friend against her parents&#x2019; wishes by jumping into the tree outside her window (and failing). However, she does not give up, and after all the obstacles that get in her way, she ends up getting to AvengersCon.&nbsp; Thereafter, she discovers her powers when she, without any hesitation, rescues one of her friends. She emanates a powerful image of a young superheroine who will be a great role model to many young girls from different communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marvel also succeeds in its depiction of Kamala&#x2019;s cultural roots, from the comedy of her friend&#x2019;s stolen shoes at the mosque to shopping for Pakistani clothes and reciting Muslim prayers. The show also touches on the implications of being a hijabi or a non-hijabi in the Muslim community in Episode 2, when Kamala talks to her close friend Nakia about her experience as a hijabi.<br><br>&#x201C;My whole life I&#x2019;ve either been too white for some people or too ethnic for others, and it&#x2019;s been this very uncomfortable, sucky in-between,&#x201D; said Nakia. &#x201C;When I first put [my hijab] on, I was hoping to shut some people up, but I kind of realized I don&#x2019;t need to prove anything to anybody. When I put this on, I feel like me &#x2014; like I have a purpose.&#x201D;<br><br>There are many <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/blog\/markaz\/2016\/01\/19\/the-right-to-choose-to-wear-or-not-hijab\/\">schools of thought<\/a> about the hijab in Islam, but Marvel showed both that the hijab can be a choice of a free-minded person and that a Muslim woman can still be a part of the religion even if she doesn&#x2019;t wear it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the show&#x2019;s soundtrack offers a platform for representation, featuring numerous Pakistani and Muslim songs and musicians such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nme.com\/en_asia\/news\/music\/pakistani-rapper-eva-bs-song-rozi-featured-in-ms-marvel-episode-i-am-feeling-so-lucky-3246997\">&#x201C;Rozi&#x201D;<\/a> by Eva B, &#x201C;Pasoori&#x201D; by Ali Sethi-Shae Gill and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bolnews.com\/entertainment\/2022\/06\/ms-marvel-features-pakistani-music\/\">many more<\/a>. Music might seem like a small detail in the series, but it makes the show even more relatable for the Muslim community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although I believe that &#x201C;Ms. Marvel&#x201D; is a major step forward for representation, there are still areas for improvement in the show. For example, Kamala&#x2019;s parents are portrayed as being more conservative, sometimes discouraging her from pursuing what she is passionate about. Perhaps this is just the classic television trope of parents being too strict with their children, but this depiction still felt somewhat stereotypical, and emphasized Western preconceptions that Islam is a restrictive and narrow-minded religion. While many Muslim women experience such conservatism in their households, it is important that the depiction of Muslim people in one of the world&#x2019;s biggest media franchises does not promote the misunderstanding that Islam is an inherently unequal religion. The fundamentals of Islam are equality, peace, respect and love.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only four episodes have been released thus far, but I hope the rest of the series will focus even more on the caring, supporting and accepting side of Islam, such as in the scene where Kamala&#8217;s parents promise that they will love Kamala no matter what and that she will never be alone. Seeing how far Marvel has come with its depictions of various communities, I remain optimistic.<br><br>&#x201C;Ms. Marvel&#x201D; is an iconic and game-changing series for Muslim representation in the MCU. Kamala Khan&#x2019;s character offers an opportunity for Muslim girls to relate to a powerful Muslim superheroine and serves as a role model who finds the motive and strength to break through the real-world challenges facing Muslim women today, from patriarchy to Islamophobia. There still remains much work to be done to improve representation in Hollywood for so many communities, but Ms. Marvel has given me hope and optimism that we will continue to see even more meaningful representation on the big screen.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a Muslim teenager, \u201cMs. Marvel\u201d means so much to

director of Stanford Hospital Epidemiology\/Infection Prevention and Control. &#x201C;It is safe, and this infection appears to be transmitted primarily through very close, intimate contact.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Current monkeypox infections present as painful rash-like blisters that appear across the body, particularly on the face, hands, chest and genitals, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/poxvirus\/monkeypox\/symptoms.html\">according<\/a> to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Other symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache and swollen lymph nodes. These symptoms commonly last 2-4 weeks until full skin recovery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stanley Deresinski, a clinical professor of infectious diseases, encouraged a calm and cautious approach to tackling the monkeypox community infection. The best way forward, he said, is through timely education about the development of the virus.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first known case of the 2022 U.S. outbreak occurred on May 18, when a U.S. citizen tested positive for monkeypox on arrival back to the United States after traveling to Canada. As of July 1, the U.S. has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/poxvirus\/monkeypox\/response\/2022\/us-map.html\">460<\/a> confirmed monkeypox cases, with 23 cases reported in the Bay Area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among U.S. states, California currently has the most cases of monkeypox with 95 confirmed cases, and New York follows close behind at 90, according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/poxvirus\/monkeypox\/response\/2022\/us-map.html\">July 1 CDC report.<\/a> Deresinski expects the number of cases in the state to continue to rise, especially during peak tourism months on the West Coast.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, the monkeypox outbreak has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/poxvirus\/monkeypox\/response\/2022\/index.html\">primarily<\/a> been seen in men who have sex with men. Given a long history of first-affected populations being scapegoated during disease outbreaks, Deresinski said he worries that the LGBTQ+ community may face heightened discrimination. Similar instances of prejudice were seen during the HIV\/AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, which was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hrc.org\/resources\/debunking-common-myths-about-hiv\">labeled<\/a> as a &#x201C;gay disease,&#x201D; and during the current COVID-19 pandemic, which has been referred to as the &#x201C;China virus&#x201D; or &#x201C;kung-flu,&#x201D; <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2021\/03\/18\/stanfords-asian-community-calls-for-allyship-in-wake-of-anti-asian-hate-crimes\/\">inciting<\/a> racist attacks against Asian Americans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Even though we have not yet verified that it&#8217;s officially sexually transmitted, we know it&#8217;s associated with sexual activities,&#x201D; said Ashley Styczynski, an assistant professor in the Department of Infectious Diseases and CDC medical officer. &#x201C;So I think that it potentially risks carrying out some of those themes, seeing issues around stigma and ostracizing people.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Salinas, the important issue is to tackle the larger issue of the virus without harmfully singling out the groups that are currently most affected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;This [outbreak] has nothing to do with the population. It has everything to do with the virus,&#x201D; he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Styczynski, the CDC and news broadcasts have so far avoided creating a stigma against afflicted individuals through approachable, specific messaging toward the populations at greatest risk &#x2014; providing those communities with data on the outbreak and allowing them to feel fully seen and supported in the health conversation.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I think it is important to not do what was done with the AIDS epidemic in closing off our minds to imagine that this could affect other populations, because that would be problematic and could be a blind spot in our approach,&#x201D; Styczynski said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Salinas, who is currently collecting samples from a monkeypox-infected patient for a small-scale study on the virus, added that, &#x201C;We would be making a mistake if we think that monkeypox will only be transmitted in [the LGBTQ+ community].&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He recommends continuing to follow the COVID-19 safety measures to combat monkeypox, including wearing a mask in crowded indoor spaces and practicing safe sex measures, with awareness to the infection status of sexual partners. For those who notice newly-developed bodily rashes or any other indication of monkeypox, Salinas suggests having their symptoms diagnosed to prevent further transmission.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After researching and working toward treatment for COVID-19 and monkeypox, Styczynski recognized the need to fund public health institutions and expand community resources &#x2014; a gap exposed by the pandemic.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;We have to build our public health infrastructure before we&#x2019;re ready to take this on in full force,&#x201D; she said, underscoring the urgency of providing medical and educational resources in areas most impacted by monkeypox.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;We need to have our finger on the pulse early, we need to be paying attention,&#x201D; Styczynski added. &#x201C;If we pay attention before it&#8217;s a crisis, we can prevent it from becoming one. &#x201C;But if we wait to care until it&#x2019;s a crisis, then we will be too late.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Monkeypox, a disease characterized by rash-like blisters, is spreading in the U.S., but is rarely fatal and much less

Carat Toothache\u201d: an emotional, lyrically complex production lacking in musical ambition"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>After over three years of inactivity from the hip-hop and pop artist Post Malone, the release of &#x201C;Twelve Carat Toothache&#x201D; diverges greatly from the style and sound of any of his past albums. The glaring differences in lyricism and production featured in this album may be a signal to fans that Post Malone is maturing as his music- making career progresses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To say Post Malone&#x2019;s career has been outstanding would be an understatement. Ever since his introduction to the music industry in 2016, Post Malone has climbed his way to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm7970428\/bio\">top of the charts<\/a> faster than almost any other artist of his time, captivating fans year after year through memorable hits such as &#x201C;Rockstar&#x201D; and &#x201C;Circles.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Post Malone&#x2019;s previous albums &#x201C;Beerbongs &amp; Bentleys&#x201D; and &#x201C;Hollywood&#x2019;s Bleeding&#x201D; aimed strictly for radio play and largely avoided the topic of his emotions, &#x201C;Twelve Carat Toothache&#x201D; sidelines the priorities of the artist&#x2019;s past releases. Instead of giving audiences an instantly engaging and digestible tracklist, the album offers mellow instrumentals and nuanced lyrics that require multiple listens to fully understand.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Twelve Carat Toothache&#x201D; was poorly received by most audiences despite debuting at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.billboard.com\/music\/chart-beat\/post-malone-twelve-carat-toothache-five-burning-questions-1235087206\/\">No. 2 on the Billboard Top 200<\/a> after its release on June 3, 2022. Grossing over 75% fewer first week sales and fewer streams than &#x201C;Hollywood&#x2019;s Bleeding,&#x201D; &#x201C;Twelve Carat Toothache&#x201D; sacrifices its musical quality and production for more lyrical expression. A first listen of the album uncovers significant flaws in forgettable choruses and bland hooks, but paying closer attention to the artist&#x2019;s words reveals &#x201C;Twelve Carat Toothache&#x201D; to be Post Malone&#x2019;s most narratively and lyrically deep album yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The album delves into Post Malone&#x2019;s battle with depression &#x2014; a struggle that has plagued him ever since his rise to fame. In his opening track &#x201C;Reputation,&#x201D; he includes unapologetic references to the topic of suicide, abandoning the playful personality of his previous albums and addressing a darker side of his life. He then tackles his issues with alcoholism head-on in &#x201C;Love\/Hate Letter To Alcohol&#x201D;; in a vignette where a drunken fight almost leads to Post Malone&#x2019;s death, the artist ascribes alcohol as the source of his problems while also singing in the chorus, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re the only way to drown my sadness.&#x201D;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In &#x201C;Lemon Tree,&#x201D; Post Malone conveys his envy toward those around him who aren&#x2019;t dealing with the same internal demons. In the song, he describes others as growing metaphorical apples and tangerines while he is stuck with a sour lemon tree. However, the track also includes a glimmer of hope for the artist, who vows to burn down his lemon tree and &#x201C;grow [him] something better.&#x201D; He alludes to the prospect of his self-improvement despite having to deal with great setbacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lacking the record-breaking hits boasted by its predecessors, &#x201C;Twelve Carat Toothache&#x201D; suffers from its basic instrumentation and somewhat boring melodies, offering audiences nothing more than a mediocre listening experience. The album&#x2019;s excessive use of reverb muddles Post Malone&#x2019;s vocals, blending his voice with the background instrumentals to the point where each song sounds messy. The repetitive style and unchanging themes of depression and alcoholism in each song causes the album to grow stale after the first couple of tracks &#x2014; a sign that the artist may be taking a step back from exploring new sounds to instead open up about his personal life to listeners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Twelve Carat Toothache&#x201D; contains many profound stories about Post Malone&#x2019;s life, but these lyrics overshadow the artist&#x2019;s musical production which often took the foreground in previous albums. &#x201C;Twelve Carat Toothache&#x201D; may not have the ear-catching hits to make it a top selling album, but Post Malone masterfully uses his lyrics as a medium to spill his feelings out to his audience. The album may have disappointed some listeners, but for the artist, it could be a stepping stone toward something greater.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cTwelve Carat

the last three days of competition at the 2022 FINA World Aquatics Championships in Budapest, Hungary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their efforts brought the overall Cardinal medal count for the championship to 14, including eight golds, two silvers and four bronzes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Records and relay wins for Huske, Smith and Curzan<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Thursday, rising sophomore Torri Huske broke the American record in the semifinals of the women&#x2019;s 50-meter butterfly with a time of 25.38. She took sixth in the finals, with a slightly slower time of 25.45.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t know the [record] time, so I didn&#x2019;t know I broke it until you just told me,&#x201D; Huske <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usaswimming.org\/news\/2022\/06\/23\/world-titles-relay-gold-and-new-american-record-on-day-six\">said<\/a> in an interview with NBC after the semifinals. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m really happy with how the meet&#x2019;s gone so far and I&#x2019;m really excited with what&#x2019;s left to come.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Huske placed fifth in the 50-meter freestyle and took bronze in the 100-meter freestyle, clocking a personal record of 52.92 in the latter. Her total of six medals has her tied with Australia&#8217;s Mollie O&#x2019;Callaghan as the swimmer with the most medals at this World Championships meet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incoming freshman Claire Curzan competed in the 50 butterfly and 100 freestyle, finishing fourth and eighth with times of 24.43 and 53.81, respectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Future teammates Huske and Curzan competed on two more relays during the last three days of the meet. They recorded splits of 52.70 and 52.84 in the 4&#215;100 mixed freestyle relay, taking bronze alongside their American teammates, Ryan Held and Brooks Curry, with a time of 3:21.09.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taylor Ruck &#x2019;22 also competed on the mixed freestyle relay though she only swam in the preliminary heats. She recorded a split of 53.92, helping Canada advance to the finals, where they ultimately took silver. Ruck was awarded a silver for her efforts in preliminary heats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the women&#x2019;s 4&#215;100 medley relay, Huske and Curzan competed with rising sophomore Regan Smith alongside Lily King. Smith recorded a time of 58.40 on the backstroke leg &#x2014; the second-fastest split across all the backstroke legs. Huske split 56.66 on butterfly, the second-fastest of the butterflyers and Curzan recorded a 52.82 on freestyle, the fourth-fastest of the freestylers. The relay team took gold with a time of 3:53.78.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Huske and Curzan each swam a total of 16 races across the course of the Championships, including preliminary heats, semifinals, finals and relays.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ledecky gets the five-peat<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie Ledecky &#x2BC;20 won the women&#x2019;s 800-meter freestyle with a time of 8:08.04 on Friday. It was the fifth-fastest performance in the history of the event, behind four of Ledecky&#x2019;s past&nbsp;performances. With her win, Ledecky became the only athlete at this meet to earn three individual gold medals. She previously <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/06\/21\/cardinal-women-make-a-splash-amid-2022-world-championships\/\">won<\/a> the 400 and 1500-meter freestyles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ledecky has not lost in the 800-meter freestyle since 2012, also taking gold at the last five World Championships.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I think back to London [the 2012 Olympics], and I made it a goal to not be a one-hit wonder,&#x201D; Ledecky <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usaswimming.org\/news\/2022\/06\/24\/ledecky-accomplishes-historic-800-free-feat-at-fina-world-championships\">told <\/a>USA Swimming. &#x201C;Here we are 10 years later, so I&#x2019;m really proud of that, and I&#x2019;m still excited for the future as well.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ledecky is the only swimmer to win a World Championship gold in the same event five consecutive times. With 14 individual World titles, she is one win away from tying Michael Phelps for the most individual World Championship titles.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Stanford-affiliated athletes closed out the 2022 meet helping their national teams to several podium finishes across a variety of events.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1003325,"featured_media":1206007,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[23,45418,646],"tags":[78251,78280,78241,78276,27309,14631,78278,74699,78279,35626,901,1029,687,51687,71346],"site-layouts":[77066],"coauthors":[78244],"parsely":{"version":"1.1.0","meta":{"@context":"https:\/\/schema.org","@type":"NewsArticle","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/07\/01\/cardinal-swimmers-finish-with-14-medals-at-world-championships\/"},"headline":"Cardinal swimmers finish with 14 medals at World Championships","url":"http:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/07\/01\/cardinal-swimmers-finish-with-14-medals-at-world-championships\/","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Flags_JT_021321_2462.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Flags_JT_021321_2462.jpg"},"dateCreated":"2022-07-02T03:50:55Z","datePublished":"2022-07-02T03:50:55Z","dateModified":"2022-07-02T04:38:38Z","articleSection":"Women's Swimming &amp;
