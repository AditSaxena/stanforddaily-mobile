night with the Stanford students advocating for Ukraine"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Kate Sliunkova arrives at the Coordination Hub at 6:30 p.m. as the sun sets over the Stanford campus, filling the sky with shades of pink and purple. Since Russia invaded Ukraine three weeks ago, the hub, a converted study room in graduate housing, has become the center of student advocacy efforts. Kate&#x2019;s phone is pressed to her ear, and she&#x2019;s ready to work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She barely gets the chance to set her belongings down before a situation requires her attention. Students are carrying boxes, lashed together with plastic and labeled with their weights. Jacob Blaeser MBA &#x2019;22 ticks off what is inside: gauze, rubbing alcohol, trauma kits. These boxes are headed to the Ukrainian border, along with 40 students in the Graduate School of Business who will carry them for the first leg of the trip as checked luggage on a school trip to Poland.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Nothing questionable?&#x201D; Kate asks, alluding to bulletproof vests or helmets &#x2014; items that would require special clearance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Nothing questionable,&#x201D; Jacob confirms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kate surveys the room, about the size of a seminar classroom. A Ukrainian flag is draped over the television, and another handmade flag for Crimea symbolizing freedom rests on a chair. A whiteboard on the side of the room details plans in dry-erase ink alongside the phonetic spelling of a Ukrainian word that native Russian speakers cannot pronounce. Near the windows hangs a poster of support decorated with pastel notes to the Ukrainian community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few students are already here, but more will trickle in through the night. Kate will provide a bit of help to everyone, a de-facto leader of the group with the tendency to use &#x201C;we&#x201D; and not &#x201C;I&#x201D; when describing their efforts. There&#x2019;s plenty already in progress, from outreach to groups at other schools to telehealth solutions and prep work to load a plane with 130 tons of supplies for Ukrainians.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She&#x2019;ll be here late into the night alongside a dozen or so other students doing whatever they can to help. While their primary goal is to organize for Ukraine, the solidarity also provides solace &#x2014; these are students who are also living through the pressure of unrelenting updates from home, students who understand that this isn&#x2019;t just another Week 10. Multiple times a day, Kate will start to shake. The tremors are worst when she&#x2019;s reading the news. When she&#x2019;s in the hub, at least she can help. And tonight, there is work to be done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DSC01229-1200x800.jpg\" alt=\"Boxes the students have assembled for Poland\" class=\"wp-image-1197806\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DSC01229-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DSC01229-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DSC01229-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DSC01229-800x533.jpg 800w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DSC01229-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DSC01229-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><figcaption>Boxes packed and ready for Poland. (Photo: EVAN PENG \/ The Stanford Daily)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">***<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kate was born and raised in Dnipro, a city in eastern Ukraine. She completed her undergraduate education in Kyiv, leaving the country soon after for a master&#8217;s degree in France, which propelled her into a career in fashion that brought her first to New York and then to Stanford to pursue an MBA and M.A. in education.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, her hometown is not a key Russian target, though the airport that she used to fly home to has been destroyed. Residents of Dnipro are helping refugees from the east and south, and Ukrainian air forces are shooting down the rockets that pass above the city to other regions. Kate&#x2019;s family members who are still in the country can&#x2019;t escape the sound of the explosions. Kyiv, the capital city, is bearing the brunt of Russian aggression, though a staunch defense from Ukrainians has kept the city from falling.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The night Russia invaded was a sleepless one for Ukrainian students, who received the news while scattered across campus. The next day, Kate and other Ukrainian students <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2022\/02\/24\/stanford-students-rally-in-support-of-ukraine\/\">met<\/a> at a student-organized rally in support of Ukraine at Main Quad, where they decided to combine their efforts. Kate secured a room in Escondido Village Graduate Residences Building B (EVGR-B), and they worked together for the first time that night. It wasn&#x2019;t just about working together, she said, but also being together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s very hard to cope when you are alone in a room,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;My initial reaction was that we needed to come together so that all the Ukrainians know that there is a place where people will be there for them.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding time for everything is not easy. For the past three weeks, Kate has been a full-time student and a full-time advocate. Kate says her spouse sometimes worries that she spends too much time with the other Ukrainian students, not thinking about her career.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I tell him that&#x2019;s what school teaches me &#x2014; to be a leader of a community, not only a leader of my class,&#x201D; she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>6:30 p.m.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kate sits down to flip open a notebook she uses to keep track of what she needs to do. The notebook is forest green and emblazoned with a Stanford logo &#x2014; it was the only one in sight when the conflict broke out. Among other tasks for tonight, she needs to reach out to a group of alumni, write thank-you notes to everyone who donated to an aid campaign and ask professors to engage with a fundraiser.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josh Pickering M.D. &#x2019;22 chimes in with updates on the status of the plane. The students are collaborating with Nova Ukraine, a local non-profit and Ukrainian aid organization, to send a plane with medical supplies and humanitarian relief to refugees at the border. He&#x2019;s finished a meeting about a potential collaboration with another school and has a status update on the logistics of getting supplies to Seattle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>7 p.m.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kate walks through the room and takes input for the dinner order, which she is coordinating tonight. Bohdan Kamets, whose partner Solomiia Savchuk M.D. &#x2019;24 attends Stanford, suggests making varenyky, a traditional Ukrainian dumpling dish. Both are volunteering with the group.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solomiia shakes her head. &#x201C;We win first and then cook,&#x201D; she says. They settle on sandwiches from Mendocino Farms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solomiia is working with a group of students and medical professionals on a telehealth platform to connect Ukrainians and physicians. The project may sound like a long shot, but the Coordination Hub has proven time and time again that they have the connections to pull off the seemingly impossible. The plane the group has secured to send supplies to the border is proof of that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;It always turns out that someone has expertise or leverage,&#x201D; Bohdan says. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re pretty much seven handshakes away from knowing everyone in the world.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I look skeptical, so he asks me how many handshakes away from the president I am, to which I respond four. He says, &#x201C;That makes you five from Putin.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In another corner of the room, laughter rings out for a video coupling bars from Brittney Spears&#x2019; &#x201C;Gimme More&#x201D; with a montage of clips of Vitaliy Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv, a city in southern Ukraine. Kim has gained international attention for his efforts to keep spirits up in the country, posting hourly updates about the war shot from his phone camera and circulating a photo with his shoes up on a table in bright socks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The memes, dark satire ridiculing Russia, have served as a real-time outlet for the grim realities of war for a younger generation. The messages don&#x2019;t always translate to English, but the intent is hard to miss: &#x201C;How can a country with a chicken on its coat of arms defeat a country with a fork,&#x201D; Kim muses in one clip.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DSC01230-1200x800.jpg\" alt=\"Solomiia Savchuk works with another student on the telehealth platform.\" class=\"wp-image-1197808\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DSC01230-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DSC01230-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DSC01230-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DSC01230-800x533.jpg 800w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DSC01230-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DSC01230-2048x1366.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><figcaption>Solomiia Savchuk (right) works with another student on the telehealth platform. (Photo: EVAN PENG \/ The Stanford Daily)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>7:30 p.m.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bohdan picks up a stack of mail from a table, so thick that he needs two hands to carry it. It&#x2019;s a collection of letters to representatives, calling for action on Ukraine. Kate confirms that he&#x2019;ll deliver the letters straight to the post office tomorrow &#x2014; they&#x2019;re not taking any chances with the drop boxes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation turns to recent reports coming out of Ukraine. Russian shelling has damaged a maternity hospital in Mariupol, and the students pull up a viral photo of an injured pregnant woman being carried from the hospital. As their conversation continues, more students join the circle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind Bohdan&#x2019;s back, a poster sits rolled up on the counter, displaying statistics from the war on March 3. Over 30 children were dead, with another 100 wounded. Since then, the numbers have climbed, with more than 100 children dead since the start of the Russian invasion. The woman and her baby from the photo have since died.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;This is not how wars are waged in any world,&#x201D; Kate says. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re coming just to cause pain.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;To destroy or to eradicate,&#x201D; adds a second volunteer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s genocide,&#x201D; Bohdan says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>8 p.m.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More graduate students have arrived to pick up aid boxes. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m happy to do something small, but I wish there was more I could do,&#x201D; one student says, taking a box from Kate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kate picks up three sticky notes that have fallen down &#x2014; &#x201C;So strong,&#x201D; &#x201C;you got this,&#x201D; &#x201C;we&#x2019;re with you&#x201D; &#x2014; and presses them to the poster on the wall. Kate originally put up the poster near an elevator in EVGR-B, inviting other students to write their support. &#x201C;When I took it down,&#x201D; she explained, &#x201C;someone who was exiting the elevator was disappointed and said I should put up another to collect more.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the students leave, she sits down again. &#x201C;I haven&#x2019;t even started,&#x201D; she says, tapping her green notebook as she thinks of how to begin the email asking others to spread word of the fundraiser.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Two weeks ago, a dark chapter began in Ukraine,&#x201D; she whispers under her breath, starting to write.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#x2019;s a quiet hour. At the start of the war, students would gather in the huddle until the crack of dawn, but now that students have begun to carve out their own niches of work, everyone&#x2019;s presence is less necessary at the hub. Still, it&#x2019;s nice to be with others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DSC01234-1200x800.jpg\" alt=\"Graduate students expressed their support for Ukrainian students on a poster. \" class=\"wp-image-1197807\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DSC01234-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DSC01234-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DSC01234-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DSC01234-800x533.jpg 800w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DSC01234-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DSC01234-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><figcaption>Graduate students expressed their support for Ukrainian students on a poster. (Photo: EVAN PENG \/ The Stanford Daily)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>9 p.m.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kate steps out to attend and take photos at a TALK, a student-run tradition where business students share a window into their lives with their classmates. On the night of the invasion, Kate had planned to take photos for a good friend&#x2019;s TALK, a role that carries significance. She had to ask another student to fill in for her that night, but tonight, she is going to make it for Tom, her friend in the business school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She grabs a sandwich on her way out the door. &#x201C;Maybe I&#x2019;ll be able to eat dinner,&#x201D; she laughs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She gets a few bites in at the event, smiling and nodding through the introductions to the speaker, before ducking in front of the crowd to take photos. It&#x2019;s a respite before she returns to the huddle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>10 p.m.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another business student pops his head in. &#x201C;Is this the Ukraine headquarters?&#x201D; he asks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kate stands up to greet him, and the student asks how her family is doing. Today was quiet, she said, and her family is optimistic, downplaying the blasts. It is impossible to know what tomorrow will bring.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She cuts herself off. &#x201C;But I&#x2019;m not here to bother you,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;Did you get a box?&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On his way out, the student takes the heaviest box that is left.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the night winds down, the huddle is almost entirely vacant. Kate thanks everyone on their way out, pausing her work to give hugs or a pat on the back. &#x201C;Thank you for your generosity,&#x201D; she tells one volunteer. &#x201C;A volunteer like you is worth a dozen other volunteers,&#x201D; she says to another.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She wraps up the email she was working on earlier. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m going to sign it, &#x2018;Thank you so much. Gratefully, Kate,&#x2019;&#x201D; she tells another volunteer. &#x201C;There are so many thank you&#x2019;s these days.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>11:30 p.m.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;We made a lot of progress today,&#x201D; one volunteer says, giving Kate a hug before leaving. She takes stock of what is left to do in her notebook before returning to her computer.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A half-hour later, she tips her phone to me, displaying a response from Nova Ukraine, the local non-profit. She&#x2019;s also in conversation with the Ukrainian Consulate in San Francisco and getting quick responses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;All the people who are working on Ukraine are awake,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s an unbelievable time. They don&#x2019;t sleep, and we don&#x2019;t sleep as well.

from the editors: Ten takeaways from \u2018100 people in 100 days\u2019"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>During the summer of 2021, The Stanford Daily conducted a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stanforddaily.com\/2021\/07\/12\/letter-from-the-editors-introducing-100-people-in-100-days\/\">listening tour<\/a> dedicated to gauging its readership&#x2019;s thoughts and perspectives on its reporting on Stanford and the surrounding community.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our goal was to interview roughly 100 people in order to better understand what we are doing well, what we need to improve on and how we can better serve the Stanford community. In total, Daily staffers were able to interview 71 community members, ranging from students &#x2014; including undergraduates, graduate students and co-terms &#x2014; to alumni and staff. We received an additional 200 responses through a survey.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on these conversations and survey responses, The Daily&#x2019;s Vol. 260 executive team and diversity, equity and inclusion co-chairs compiled ten takeaways that will inform our newsroom moving forward.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Our readership is digital: <\/strong>Interviews and survey data alike show that our readership primarily accesses Daily content through our email digest and website. The implications are clear: Our digital presence needs to be a top priority for our staff. Already, this volume marks the first where The Daily has moved from printing daily to once a week, with the goal of focusing on producing content for the web. We&#x2019;ve also created two new roles to further this work. Lana Tleimat &#x2019;23 is serving as the executive editor for digital, and Cameron Ehsan &#x2019;24 is our first audience engagement editor, responsible for keeping an eye on readership metrics. We&#x2019;ll continue to make progress in this area through investing in training, technology, audience engagement, search engine optimization and more.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>Growing our multimedia offerings: <\/strong>Some community members said that they would love to see more multimedia content, including, as one interviewee put it, &#x201C;formats and layouts that capture the creativity and essence of our community.&#x201D; Interviewees suggested a range of projects, from incorporating audio recordings of events into articles to featuring more graphics. We recognize the importance of growth in this area, and to that end, this volume, we&#x2019;ve financially invested in physical and digital equipment upgrades for our multimedia sections. This includes new cameras, a video editing computer and more: Investments that allow these sections to produce high quality work and reduce the barrier to entry for staff who do not have access to this equipment otherwise. Standout content from this volume includes a <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2021\/10\/06\/photo-gallery-cardinal-shock-no-3-oregon\/\">photo gallery<\/a> of Stanford football&#x2019;s nail-biting defeat of then-No. 3 Oregon, a <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2021\/10\/07\/video-professors-react-to-mean-course-reviews\/\">video<\/a> of professors reacting to mean course reviews and a <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/4Pgc3OnqTdsKpuYNhrj4Ei\">podcast<\/a> on imposter syndrome.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>Expanding coverage of graduate students, faculty and staff:<\/strong> Some community members stressed the importance of ensuring that The Daily&#x2019;s coverage spans issues relevant not only to undergraduates but to graduate students, faculty, staff and postdoctoral scholars. The Daily&#x2019;s staff is overwhelmingly composed of undergraduate students, leading one interviewee to reflect that there is a lack of communication between undergraduates and graduate students on campus, which then leads to less coverage of graduate student priorities. This volume, the news section re-introduced having a <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/category\/news\/graduate-students\/\">graduate students desk<\/a>, tasked with taking a deeper dive into the issues that affect the University&#x2019;s nearly 10,000 graduate students. This feedback is also being taken into account by section editors in the pitching and sourcing stages of our writing process.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\"><li><strong>Spotlights on community members: <\/strong>Some community members said that in addition to the profiles and Q&amp;As The Daily publishes on high-profile students, faculty and alumni, they would like to read more spotlights of underrecognized members of the community. One interviewee said they hoped to see more content that focuses on the everyday life of a Stanford student, while others said that they would love to see more coverage of service workers, who are beloved by many students and community members. For such coverage, readers can follow and submit names to The Daily&#x2019;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/humans_of_stanford\/\">@humans_of_stanford<\/a> account on Instagram, which was restarted this fall by Saloni Shah &#x2019;25, as well as keep an eye out for profiles on our website, such as Chloe Mendoza&#x2019;s &#x2019;25 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stanforddaily.com\/2021\/11\/15\/you-are-what-you-eat-meet-the-people-who-feed-us\/\">interview<\/a> with a member of the Branner and Gerhard Casper dining staff.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"5\"><li><strong>Digging deeper for student reactions:<\/strong> Some community members said they also want to see more in-depth coverage of students&#x2019; reactions to major campus decisions and world events, such as news managing editor Malaysia Atwater&#x2019;s &#x2019;23 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stanforddaily.com\/2021\/01\/06\/insurrection-with-little-intervention-black-students-disappointed-but-unsurprised-by-lack-of-immediate-police-action-at-u-s-capitol\/\">piece<\/a> on Black students being disappointed but unsurprised by lack of immediate police action at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 or news desk editors Benjamin Zaidel &#x2019;24 and Tammer Bagdasarian &#x2019;24&#x2019;s piece on student reactions to Stanford <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stanforddaily.com\/2021\/01\/09\/theyre-harming-people-with-this-students-react-to-cancellation-of-in-person-winter-quarter\/\">moving<\/a> winter quarter 2021 online. Interviewees said they want to see these pieces being published more frequently and pushing further to capture the diverse perspectives of the campus community.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"6\"><li><strong>Exploring issues from all sides: <\/strong>One concern some community members raised was that The Daily&#x2019;s coverage unfairly focuses on certain perspectives, leaving readers with only one side of the story. The Daily aims to provide the Stanford community with fair, accurate and ethical journalism. We will continue to take this feedback into consideration as we work to produce coverage that tells authentic, diverse and layered stories of the many different individuals, perspectives and communities on campus.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"7\"><li><strong>Interview etiquette: <\/strong>Some community members stressed the importance of training new writers to conduct interviews professionally. Sourcing and interviewing are key stages of the writing process that are integral to the success of the final piece. The Daily will continue to work on ensuring that staff are conducting interviews with empathy and fairness, including working with sources to set the rules of an interview and explaining unfamiliar terms. Additionally, as stated in <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/our-policies-and-standards\/\">our<\/a> policies and standards, when an assertion is made by a source about a specific person or organization, they will be contacted and given a reasonable amount of time to respond before publication.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"8\"><li><strong>Building institutional knowledge and long-term relationships with activists: <\/strong>Some community members voiced concerns that The Daily has published articles by writers who do not fully understand the social, political or administrative issue at hand, resulting in a surface-level or inaccurate final product. To address this, interviewees urged writers to build relationships with the communities and activists that they are covering, such as by designating a &#x201C;point person&#x201D; for each group or issue or by proactively meeting with stakeholders in certain coverage areas to ensure regular communication. This volume, the news section has continued implementation of its beat reporters initiative, where more experienced writers take on coverage of a specific area, such as Greek life or campus activism. Additionally, The Daily&#x2019;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stanforddaily.com\/equity-project-section-guide\/\">Equity Project<\/a> is a section that is dedicated to community-oriented journalism and centering underrepresented voices.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"9\"><li><strong>Coverage of marginalized and diverse groups:<\/strong> Some community members said they want to see more coverage of issues that pertain to community members of color, first-generation and\/or low-income students, international students and other diverse communities on campus. The Daily believes it is crucial that everyone feels represented in our coverage, as everyone has stories that deserve to be told. We hope to amplify the voices and stories of those who have otherwise been left out of Daily coverage and to encourage diverse people to join and cover issues that they care about. In addition to the Equity Project, which was launched in Vol. 258, in Vol. 259 The Daily launched its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stanforddaily.com\/2021\/02\/04\/introducing-the-dailys-inaugural-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-team\/\">inaugural<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/category\/dei\/\">diversity, equity and inclusion<\/a> (DEI) team, which works to ensure that our content is equitable and inclusive and that our staff represents the campus community and the world around us.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"10\"><li><strong>Publicizing avenues to contribute to The Daily: <\/strong>One of the goals of The Daily&#x2019;s leadership is to ensure that everyone in the Stanford community feels that they have a platform to share and express their perspectives through our publication. However, some community members said they were unsure of how to submit ideas and pieces to The Daily or join our staff. In the future, we hope to better publicize opportunities with The Daily, both internally and externally. Thanks to the work of newsroom development director Emma Talley &#x2019;23, this year The Daily set a recruitment record, evidence that our methods of outreach are becoming more effective. Staffers also distributed a one-page handout with information on how to contact The Daily to community members. You can join The Daily <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stanforddaily.com\/join\/\">here<\/a> and learn more about how tips, op-eds and other content can be submitted to The Daily <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stanforddaily.com\/submitting-to-the-daily\/\">here<\/a>.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We thank everyone who contributed to our summer listening tour; we are immensely grateful for your willingness to help us grow. In addition to this public report, we&#x2019;ll be distributing section-specific insights from the conversations and survey to our section editors. Though the tour itself may be over, our hope is that this outreach will not be an isolated event, but rather the start of an ongoing conversation between The Daily and the community that we serve. To that end, if you would like to continue this conversation, don&#x2019;t hesitate to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stanforddaily.com\/submitting-to-the-daily\/\">reach out<\/a>, whether through sending in

volume.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#x2019;re excited to take the lead as students return to campus in full force after one and a half years away. We&#x2019;re looking forward to bringing the Stanford community timely and important journalism through our website, print edition, magazine and yearbook.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the executive team, we hope to make progress on two fronts: improving our digital presence and promoting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in our coverage and among our staff. These are changes that reflect lessons learned during the pandemic and ongoing shifts in the journalism landscape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#x2019;s start with our digital presence. Already, in a good month, our website can draw over 400,000 visitors, a number that pales in comparison to our print readership. To that end, we&#x2019;ll be cutting print production from five days to one day a week, freeing staff time and money to focus on projects for our website. We&#x2019;ve also created two new roles to further this work. Lana Tleimat &#x2019;23 will serve as the executive editor for digital, and Cameron Ehsan &#x2019;24 will be our first audience engagement editor, responsible for keeping an eye on readership metrics and developing a team of engagement reporters who are responsive to the trends and needs of the community. Additionally, we&#x2019;ve dedicated $30,000 in much-needed tech upgrades so that our digital sections &#x2014; tech, photo, video, podcasting, graphics and cartoons &#x2014; can produce their best work and those without the means to access such technology can take part in these sections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#x2019;re also making strides to improve the diversity, equity and inclusion of our newsroom. We launched the &#x201C;<a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2021\/07\/12\/letter-from-the-editors-introducing-100-people-in-100-days\/\">100 People in 100 Days<\/a>&#x201D; listening tour over the summer, during which time we met with community members to ask how we can better serve them. A report on our findings is forthcoming. We also just wrapped up hosting our inaugural <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2021\/07\/12\/letter-from-the-editors-introducing-100-people-in-100-days\/\">Summer Journalism Institute<\/a>, a two-week internship program for more than 60 incoming frosh and current students from backgrounds underrepresented in journalism. We hope to follow these initiatives during the school year with greater funding for our <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/opportunity-fellowship\/\">Opportunity Fellowship<\/a>, $1,500 stipends for staffers with financial need; further development of our affinity group and mentorship opportunities; and a reexamination of newsroom policies with the potential for harm, such as the way we cover policing on campus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout this process of growth and change, we want to hear from you, whether that&#x2019;s by <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/tips\/\">submitting a tip<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/submitting-to-the-daily\/\">an article<\/a> or even <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/u\/4\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSf2o_zv_ubfi1gS9yDVf0kFGoorPYjup4fMq6ISjJiBVvD1Sw\/formResponse\">joining our team<\/a>. We take everyone who applies, and the time commitment is as little or as much as you&#x2019;d like it to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#x2019;s a bit more about us:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kate is an aspiring reporter from central Massachusetts, studying philosophy and political science. Before taking on the editor-in-chief role, she led The Daily&#x2019;s news section for two volumes and co-chaired the diversity, equity and inclusion team for one. She&#x2019;s a member of Asian American Journalists Association and NLGJA: The Association of LGBTQ Journalists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeremy hails from New York City, and, before becoming the executive editor for print, was a two-time sports editor at The Daily. He majors in Human Biology with specific focuses in environmental policy and sustainable development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lana is from Columbus, Ohio, which is cooler than it sounds. She wrote and edited humor articles and produced satirical news videos for The Daily before becoming the inaugural executive editor of digital. She will eventually get around to studying English with a focus in creative writing, hopefully before she graduates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#x2019;re looking forward to the volume ahead!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kate Selig &#x2019;23, Editor in Chief<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeremy Rubin &#x2019;23, Executive Editor for Print<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lana Tleimat &#x2019;23, Executive Editor for

two-week internship program for incoming frosh from backgrounds underrepresented in journalism. Stanford students who are not currently on staff are also welcome to apply.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program will run from Aug. 29 to Sept. 10, with an expected time commitment of 8 to 10 hours a week. Participants will get the opportunity to learn more about our digital and content-producing sides, attend lectures and workshops with section editors, and speak with professionals in the industry. The participants will also be able to partake in social programming and be mentored by Daily staffers. Their work will have the chance to be published on our website.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#x2019;re not just looking for prospective reporters and sportswriters &#x2014; if you&#x2019;re interested in the intersection of journalism with tech, graphics, data and more there&#x2019;s a place for you in the program. Section editors from just about every section of The Daily will be available during the program, and you can read more about each of our sections <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/join#opportunities\">here<\/a>. (Applications for the fall recruitment class are not yet open.)<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our hope is that the institute will serve as a valuable training opportunity and also give incoming students the chance to work one-on-one with current section editors before the start of the school year. Though The Daily prides itself on its recruitment numbers &#x2014; more than 300 members of the frosh class signed up to join in 2019, and The Daily doesn&#x2019;t turn anyone away &#x2014; it&#x2019;s easy for students to get lost in the shuffle, especially for those who have not been traditionally represented in the ranks of our staff or in the industry at large.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This unfortunately is not a paid program, though our hope is that The Daily can compensate interns in future years. However, if institute participants become members of our staff, The Daily does offer an <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/opportunity-fellowship\/\">Opportunity Fellowship<\/a>, which can provide up to $1,500 a semester to staffers with financial need.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/oOcgAsrsIgLL7lFZB2b_tvDvpm99znq9JuV3E9XoLbLd1weZhKG0k2VQSSla1-2jwNuNubVCzm15xItlCltaVEDCoY1lF0mLIi8BtGwNHb6-EXFc3UggEwoRYznlqJMEnT0edPFd\" alt=\"Photos of the program directors.\"\/><figcaption>From left to right: Christine, Anastasiia and Lorenzo.

co-chairs, and we&#x2019;re excited to announce the creation of the team and the initiatives we&#x2019;re working on.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DEI team is charged with spearheading the push to improve diversity and equity within the paper&#x2019;s newsroom, as well as supporting our community outreach efforts. The team was born out of discussions on issues of equity in journalism held by staffers over winter break, and it embodies our commitment to seeing those conversations translate into structural changes at The Daily.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The paper is not where many want it to be. We&#x2019;ve heard from students of color that they don&#x2019;t feel reflected in our coverage. We&#x2019;ve heard from the Stanford community the many times we&#x2019;ve fallen short, failing to include the perspectives of those most affected or equivocating where conviction was needed in covering Title IX, Black Lives Matter protest, student deaths and more. We know that not all staffers at The Daily feel welcome and that not all students interested in joining The Daily see a place for them among its staff.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when it comes to the paper&#x2019;s demographics, a survey from Vol. 258 shows that our staff is overwhelmingly made up of white and East Asian students. The vast majority of our staffers are also straight, cisgender and able-bodied. Less than 20% of staffers are first-generation college students &#x2014; roughly equal to the amount of staffers with legacy staffers. The majority of staffers are upper-middle class and do not receive financial aid, even though <a href=\"https:\/\/financialaid.stanford.edu\/undergrad\/#:~:text=Approximately%2070%25%20of%20our%20students,of%20%2413%2C600%20toward%20their%20bills.\">47%<\/a> of Stanford students receive financial aid.&nbsp; In many ways, The Daily staff is not representative of the Stanford community, and this gap is particularly crucial in the communities where our coverage has fallen short.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To remedy these issues identified, the DEI team is currently focusing on five broad initiatives:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Increasing community outreach to the parts of campus we&#x2019;ve underserved in the past, including FLI and minority students and student organizations.<\/li><li>Conducting internal demographics surveys of The Daily&#x2019;s staff to understand where we&#x2019;re falling short and communicating the results to the Stanford community.<\/li><li>Conducting ongoing education of The Daily&#x2019;s staff on issues of diversity and inclusion, including hosting a discussion series, bringing in guest speakers and conducting staff training on such issues.<\/li><li>Improving the quality of our coverage by incorporating the voices of those affected by the issues we cover and redefining what stories we consider to be &#x201C;newsworthy.&#x201D;<\/li><li>Improving inclusion within The Daily and making it a space where all staffers feel welcome.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>We think that it is crucial that everyone feels represented in our coverage, and everyone has stories that deserve to be told. Going forward, we hope to amplify the voices and stories of those who have otherwise been left out of Daily coverage and to encourage diverse people to join and cover issues that they care about. We hope to make The Daily a space where everyone feels supported and where everyone can thrive.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to share a bit about ourselves: Kate is a rising sophomore from Massachusetts.

Then the pandemic sent them back home. By Kate Selig\">\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<span style=\"text-align: left;\">(Graphic: AMY LO\/The Stanford Daily)<\/span><br><br>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"font-size: 14px;margin:5px;padding: 10px;background-color: #dfb0e7; width: 50%;float:right;\"><i>This story contains references to homophobia and homophobic incidents that may be troubling to some readers, and includes a list of resources for queer students at the end.<\/i><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-dropcap\">When Stanford announced it would send students home due to the coronavirus last winter, students&#x2019; hearts sank across campus. And for queer students closeted at home, the announcement marked an especially heartbreaking change in fortunes. Students finally able to be out with their identities on campus were sent back into the closet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, almost a full year after the announcement, none of them deny that the pandemic has been tough, really tough. But behind physical isolation and separation from peers, queer students closeted at home have strengthened friendships, built up queer student organization programming and learned how to access queer resources on campus.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pandemic has exacerbated the trauma of being closeted, but also highlighted many queer students&#x2019; resilience and hope for a better future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center; color: #5c297a; font-size: 3em; margin-top: 40px;margin-bottom:30px;\"><strong>Back in the closet<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p class=\"has-dropcap\">All 10 students interviewed said that coming to Stanford, a safer place where most are accepting of queer people, was something they looked forward to. And once there, students were able to find queer community, or at the very least, friends they could talk to about their identities. The names of most students have been changed out of respect for the privacy of students who remain closeted.<\/p><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Stanford was an escape, where I was able to surround myself with people who would call myself by my preferred name, use my pronouns and otherwise understand who I really was and accept me for that,&#x201D; said Bea, a nonbinary rising sophomore on leave.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Returning home &#x2014; and returning to the closet &#x2014; marked the loss of in-person queer community for students, as well as the ability to explore their identity and express themselves fully.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;One of the many survival strategies of being queer is being able to effortlessly switch your persona based on what is expedient in your living situation,&#x201D; Bea said. To avoid outing themselves to their parents, Bea has had to resort to tactics they relied on in high school, like using their dead name strategically and being more strict about what they wear and how they act to appear more traditionally masculine.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping their identities under wraps while talking with friends or other members of the queer community has also required students to become more stealthy. They mentioned going on walks while speaking with friends or needing to switch from calls to text whenever queerness was brought up. Cameron, a nonbinary sophomore who lived on campus with their partner during the fall, said they had to take down their pride flag whenever they Facetimed their parents, putting it back up again as soon as the call was done.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Amina, a queer senior living at home, calls with understanding friends, having her septum piercing in and listening to music by queer artists are some of the ways she&#x2019;s getting through the pandemic. But if her parents knock on her door, she&#x2019;ll change the subject of conversation from queerness, remove her piercing and shut off the music.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;In a sense, it&#x2019;s almost kind of funny,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;But at the heart of it, it&#x2019;s not.&#x201D;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are small victories. She&#x2019;s figured out how to &#x201C;toe the line&#x201D; in the way she dresses, allowing her to express her queerness without creating too many red flags for her parents: &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want to forget who I am and force myself into a box.&#x201D;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"width: 100vw;position: relative;left: 50%;right: 50%;margin-left: -50vw;margin-right: -50vw;margin-bottom: 1em;\">\n            <img style=\"width:100%;\" src=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/pasted-image-0.png\" alt=\"A purple graphic of a person's face with their nose pierced\">\n            <span style=\"text-align: center;\">(Graphic: AMY LO\/The Stanford Daily)<\/span>\n        <\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Other social identities like race and religion may influence how parents approach the subject of queerness&nbsp;&#x2014; and how some queer students themselves approach internalized homophobia and transphobia.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stella, a pansexual sophomore also exploring her gender identity, thinks her parents&#x2019; reaction to having a queer child would be influenced by their background as Asian immigrants. She said her parents have fought hard to achieve the American dream, and they wouldn&#x2019;t want their child to face setbacks for being queer.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;If you consider the stereotypical American family, you have like one man, one woman and some kids, and maybe a dog or something,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s not going to be my life. I don&#x2019;t even like dogs.&#x201D;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For frosh closeted at home, losing the chance to come to campus has been particularly hard. While students could apply for on-campus housing if they had &#x201C;special circumstances,&#x201D; which included unsafe or unwelcoming home environments, many said they did not apply to avoid taking a spot from students who might need it more.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex, a genderqueer frosh, is disappointed they didn&#x2019;t get to experience the physical presence of the queer community during the fall, as well as the opportunity to put some distance between themself and their less-than-accepting family. While they&#x2019;ve been able to make some friends who are also queer, Zoom conversations feel less personal than the impromptu, late-night dorm discussions they were looking forward to having in college.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex looks forward to coming to campus when conditions permit: &#x201C;When you&#x2019;re at school, you can have a foot in two worlds and step into the school world a bit more if things are uncomfortable at home,&#x201D; they said.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div><h2 style=\"text-align:center; color: #5c297a; font-size: 3em; margin-top: 40px;margin-bottom:30px;\"><strong>Silver linings<\/strong><\/h2><p class=\"has-dropcap\">Not all students live in homes where they can&#x2019;t bring up queerness. For those whose parents have indicated more openness but still have hostility toward queerness, the pandemic has been a chance for students to push back on their parents&#x2019; beliefs and have conversations that would have otherwise been delayed. Stella has been using humor, like joking about what would happen if she dated a girl, to try to introduce and normalize queerness with her parents.<\/p><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>And for some students, the decision to not be out with their families is just a matter of mental bandwidth, of which there is very little during this pandemic. Dhruv, a gay junior, said he has &#x201C;full faith&#x201D; his parents will eventually accept his identity but he doesn&#x2019;t have the mental capacity to start that conversation right now.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said he feels he can still express himself at home, making coming out seem less urgent. &#x201C;They even know I&#x2019;m a Zumba instructor,&#x201D; he joked. &#x201C;My dad thinks it&#8217;s amazing.&#x201D;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One silver lining for many students is that the pandemic has afforded more mental space to come to terms with and understand their identity. For Sofia, a sophomore, it took stepping away from the rush of frosh year to realize she was queer. Now, she&#x2019;s working through how to navigate this identity with a parent who is not accepting.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s funny &#x2014; at Stanford, there&#x2019;s no time to reflect,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;And I needed to take a step back to think about everything and stop being in denial.&#x201D;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And instead of being shunted back in the closet, Emily Snell &#x2019;23, who identifies as lesbian, came out to her family during the pandemic. Her hometown in Bellville, Ohio, is blatantly homophobic, she said. In November, members of her town hosted a Trump rally that evolved into an anti-gay rights and anti-women&#x2019;s rights rally.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response, she <a href=\"https:\/\/www.richlandsource.com\/solutions\/complicating-the-narrative-at-an-lgbtq-rally\/article_b38870b0-1c8a-11eb-a265-732f124da779.html\">organized<\/a> an LGBTQ+ rights rally &#x2014; marking her coming out to her hometown.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;It was a really beautiful experience,&#x201D; she said. She&#x2019;s looking forward to getting involved with the activist community when she returns to Stanford, as well as building out a club for queer students who are Christian.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another silver lining exists in the friendships and community students made on campus and have maintained through the pandemic. In a sense, thanks to these friendships, living at home is less isolating than it was before college for many queer students.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bea, the nonbinary student who talked about survival strategies, said having people to confide in and talk to has made a big difference, even if their support system is stretched across thousands of miles, and even if connection is just through a text.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when they return to campus next year? &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll hold my queer friends a lot closer,&#x201D; they said.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"width: 100vw;position: relative;left: 50%;right: 50%;margin-left: -50vw;margin-right: -50vw;margin-bottom: 1em;\">\n            <img style=\"width:100%;\" src=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/pasted-image-0-1.png\">\n            <span style=\"text-align: center;\">(Graphic: AMY LO\/The Stanford Daily)<\/span>\n        <\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-dropcap\">Dhruv, the student able to express their queerness at home, encouraged queer students feeling alone to try getting involved with queer student groups on campus. He is involved with Queer and Questioning Asians and Pacific Islanders (Q&amp;A) on campus, which is continuing to put on programming throughout the pandemic.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re not alone, and even if you don&#x2019;t see it, your experience is shared,&#x201D; he said, speaking to students who aren&#x2019;t out in their home communities.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Student government mental health and wellness co-director Robyn Radecki &#x2019;21 also emphasized that there are resources on campus for queer students, including student groups and mental health resources. Radecki has also previously worked with the Weiland Health Initiative, which provides mental health and wellness support to queer students, and Queer Student Resources (QSR).<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Each situation comes with its own unique challenges, but regardless, the pure fact of not being out in some capacity is very restrictive and can lead to a lot of mental health issues,&#x201D; she said.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Queer youth have been found to be at greater risk for mental illnesses like depression and anxiety and are at a higher risk for attempting suicide. Supportive families <a href=\"https:\/\/suicidepreventionlifeline.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/LGBTQ_MentalHealth_OnePager.pdf\">help<\/a>, with one study finding that transgender children whose families affirmed their identity were as psychologically healthy as their non-transgender peers, but youth with the least accepting families were far more likely to experience mental health problems.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (CAPS) and Weiland offer a range of services to students, including individual therapy and hormone replacement therapy consultations for students in California. Weiland and Queer Student Resources also offer community-building programming and educational resources for students, like the <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1YAZzS8CQc7MxZci8Ki04UkV7ohC-hk6guDyUnO3LSAU\/edit\">First Aid Kit<\/a> that queer students can use to help navigate being at home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Knowing that there will continue to be uncertainty around the pandemic, campus life and your own life, there are still things that can be done to protect yourself and nurture your spirit,&#x201D; said Weiland program manager Marissa Floro. She encouraged students to take steps like cultivating support networks, utilizing available resources and seeking therapy as needed to navigate the pandemic.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feelings of isolation and depression are understandable and even expected during this time, Floro said, but &#x201C;the pandemic, and all things, are temporary.&#x201D;&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Campus life will eventually go back to &#x2018;normal,&#x2019; we will once again be able to be with each other in community, holding each other up and celebrating our authentic selves,&#x201D; she added.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noah, a queer rising sophomore, said addressing his mental health needs with Stanford resources has been important to him during the pandemic. He encouraged students in similar situations to reach out to people they trust and consider professional counseling or calling the CAPS hotline &#x2014; and understand that the current situation is temporary.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Freshman year almost feels like a dream sometimes when I look back, but when we return, it will be nice to realize that it did in fact happen,&#x201D; he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"background-color: #dfb0e7; padding: 15px;margin-top: 15px;margin-bottom: 15px;\"><p><i>\nAuthor&#x2019;s note: If you or someone you know is in a similar situation, there are available resources both on and beyond campus.

Over a hundred protested the rollout at Stanford Hospital on Friday morning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The approximately 1,300 residents and fellows often work 80 or more hours per week and are being actively recruited to join COVID-19 intensive care teams amid the surge in cases. In some instances, residents and fellows were passed over for vaccination in favor of senior faculty and attendings who are working from home or have minimal contact with COVID-positive patients.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stanford Medicine leadership apologized for the botched vaccine distribution in a Friday letter to colleagues. &#x201C;We fully recognize we should have acted more swiftly to address the errors that resulted in an outcome we did not anticipate,&#x201D; leaders wrote. &#x201C;We are truly sorry.&#x201D;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the letter, signed by staff members like Stanford Health Care President David Entwistle and Chief Medical Officer Niraj Sehgal, leadership added they are optimistic that a large shipment of vaccines will arrive next week, which will allow Stanford Medicine to vaccinate a &#x201C;substantial segment&#x201D; of its staff.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Food and Drug Administration <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/live\/2020\/12\/18\/world\/covid-19-coronavirus\">authorized<\/a> Moderna&#x2019;s vaccine for emergency use on Friday night, allowing the shipment of millions more doses nationwide.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the protest, with chants like &#x201C;First in the room, back of the line,&#x201D; residents said leadership had previously indicated to residents and fellows that they would be included in the first wave of vaccination.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In later interviews with The Daily, residents said Stanford Medicine&#x2019;s initial decision not to allocate vaccines to them was disheartening, especially when many have stepped up to work with COVID-19-positive patients.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s really, really hard when you&#x2019;re making those sacrifices to feel so under-prioritized in the vaccine allocation system,&#x201D; said Alisha Tolani &#x2019;10 M.D. &#x2019;17, an obstetrics and gynecology chief resident. &#x201C;The goodwill and trust that people have is waning.&#x201D;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tolani said residents had not been included in the first wave of vaccinations due to the algorithm Stanford Medicine is using to determine who gets priority. One element of priority was the unit staff are in; since residents switch between units, they were not assigned a location, and by extension, no priority, according to Tolani. Age also likely pushed them down the list.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stanford Health Care spokesperson Julie Greicius declined to confirm the details of the algorithm. Multiple members of Stanford&#x2019;s vaccine committee also declined requests for interviews on the subject.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third-year resident J. Bradley Segal said the algorithm also likely prioritizes individual risk over occupational risk. Thus, a young resident tasked with intubating COVID-19 patients would be lower on the vaccine list than an older attending working from home.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He expressed skepticism of Stanford&#x2019;s plan to vaccinate more residents and fellows within the week. &#x201C;Yeah, we&#x2019;ve heard that one before,&#x201D; he said, later adding that the email from administrators, titled &#x201C;COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution Plan,&#x201D; included no specifics on the distribution plan.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Greicius wrote that Stanford is &#x201C;immediately revising our plan to better sequence the distribution of the vaccine.&#x201D;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fourth-year anesthesiology resident Anthony Sawyer has taken care of COVID-19-positive patients and has very likely intubated one &#x2014; a procedure that requires doctors to get in close contact with a patient while inserting a tube into their airway.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I appreciate an admission that this didn&#x2019;t go well,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;But how are we going to change the system so that those who are most vulnerable are

But after June 15, about 60 workers who did not qualify for federal employment benefits, such as those who work multiple jobs, no longer received pay continuation, according to SEIU Janitorial Bay Area Coordinator Cesar Quiles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>University spokesperson E.J. Miranda wrote in an email to The Daily that &#x201C;Stanford met its stated commitment to UG2 for pay continuation of laid-off workers through August 31, exactly as communicated to UG2 and the custodial union.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>UG2 and campus UG2 leadership did not respond to multiple requests for comment. It is unclear what responsibility for the lack of pay continuation lies with Stanford and what lies with UG2.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Union leaders and workers said the lack of pay has hurt individuals and families who rely on that money.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re facing a pandemic, and people still have to pay rent and buy food to put on the table,&#x201D; said SEIU California 1st Vice President Denise Solis. &#x201C;Stanford could fix this tomorrow by writing a check.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A worker who retained their job said she knew laid-off co-workers who were now cleaning houses and selling food, like tamales and pupusas, to make ends meet. Others, she said, have gone to Mexico to find work.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One laid-off worker said neither Stanford nor UG2 clearly communicated what had changed after June 15 when she stopped receiving pay continuation. The loss of money has been hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I am struggling &#x2014; I am a single mother of three children, and only I brought support to my home,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I need my job.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Miranda declined to comment on concerns raised about the consequences of the loss of pay continuation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Union leaders said the loss of pay continuation is compounded by laid-off UG2 workers not knowing when they will come back to work. At the time of the layoffs, UG2 <a href=\"https:\/\/stanforddaily.com\/2020\/04\/03\/ug2-to-lay-off-over-130-subcontracted-employees-without-continuation-pay\/\">wrote in a notice<\/a> to government agencies that they hope to bring back &#x201C;some or all&#x201D; of the employees once &#x201C;business conditions improve&#x201D; and &#x201C;government officials permit our customer(s) to resume operations.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;We are getting calls from members that ask every day when are they coming back to work, and we don&#8217;t know what to tell them anymore,&#x201D; Solis said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Miranda declined to directly comment on the union&#x2019;s concerns, <a href=\"https:\/\/healthalerts.stanford.edu\/covid-19\/2020\/11\/09\/winter-quarter-plans\/\">citing<\/a> a November update from Provost Persis Drell.

The update did not mention contract firms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students have also taken up the issue of pay continuation. The Undergraduate Senate and Graduate Student Council passed a <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1DHMi1mgQHcP8OVrczQE3t-BOZd-qp1Elte3Y1cTCtv0\/edit\">resolution<\/a> authored by Students for Workers&#x2019; Rights in early fall urging Stanford to provide the pay continuation, as well as augment current policies to include hazard pay and access to proper protection for workers during the pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU) has since requested that the Faculty Senate discuss the matter. The Faculty Senate&#x2019;s Steering Committee, which is responsible for setting the Faculty Senate&#x2019;s agenda, will discuss how to proceed with the request on Jan. 19, according to Assistant Academic Secretary Adrienne Emory, who added that the issue is not within the Faculty Senate&#x2019;s jurisdiction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ASSU Co-Director of Community Responsibility Adam Nayak &#x2019;22 called on Stanford to rectify the issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Regardless of where this misstep occurred, the fact remains that these workers are without pay three months after they were promised pay and are without any sort of idea as to why this occurred,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s just fix the situation.&#x201D;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Quotes from UG2 workers were given in Spanish and were translated into English.
